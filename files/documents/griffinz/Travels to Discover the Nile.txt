   _Return from the Source of the Nile by Maitsha--Come to the
   House of Welled Amlac--Reception there--Pass the Nile at
   Delakus--Arrive at Gondar._


It was on the 10th of November 1770 we left Geesh in our return to
Gondar, and passed the Abay, as before, under the church of Saint
Michael Sacala. We descended the hill through the wood, crossed the
river Davola, and that night halted at a few huts, called Dembea, on
the north-east side of the entrance of a valley.

On the 11th we continued our journey in our former road, till we
arrived at the church of Abbo; we then turned to the right, our course
N. by E. and at three quarters past nine rested under the mountain on
the right of the valley; our road lay still through Goutto, but the
country here is neither so well inhabited nor so pleasant as the west
side of the Nile. At eleven, going N. N. E. we passed the church of
Tzion, about an eight part of a mile distant to E. N. E.; we here have
a distinct view of the valley thro' which runs the Jemma, deep, wide,
and full of trees, which continue up the sides of the mountains Amid
Amid. At a quarter past eleven we passed a small stream coming from
the west, and at twelve another very dangerous river called Utchmi,
the ford of which is in the midst of two cataracts, and the stream
very rapid; after passing this river, we entered a narrow road in the
midst of brush-wood, pleasant and agreeable, and full of a kind of
foxes[1] of a bright gold colour. At three quarters past one we halted
at the house of Shalaka Welled Amlac, with whom I was well acquainted
at Gondar; his house is called Welled Abea Abbo, from a church of Abbo
about an eight part of a mile distant.

I have deferred, till the present occasion, the introducing of this
remarkable character to my reader, that I might not trouble him to
go back to past transactions that are not of consequence enough to
interrupt the thread of my narrative. Soon after I had seen part
of the royal family, that had been infected with the small-pox,
happily recovered, and was settled at Koscam in a house of my own,
formerly belonging to Basha Eusebius, my friend Ayto Aylo recommended
to my care a man from Maitsha, with two servants, one of whom, with
his master, had been taken ill of the intermitting fever. As I was
supplied plentifully with every necessary by the Iteghé, the only
inconvenience that I suffered by this was, that of bringing a stranger
and a disease into my family. But as I was in a strange country, and
every day stood in need of the assistance of the people in it, it
was necessary that I should do my part, and make myself as useful as
possible when the opportunity came in my way. I therefore submitted,
and according to Ayto Aylo's desire, received my two patients with
the best grace possible; and the rather, as I was told that he was
one of the most powerful, resolute, and best-attended robbers in all
Maitsha; that he lay directly in my way to the source of the Nile; and
that, under his protection, I might bid defiance to Woodage Asahel,
considered as the great obstacle to my making that journey.

The servant was a poor, timid wretch, exceedingly afraid of dying.
He adhered strictly to his regimen, and was very soon recovered. It
was not so with Welled Amlac; he had, as I said, another servant,
who never, that I saw, came within the door; but as often as I was
out attending my other patients, or with the Iteghé, which was great
part of the morning, he stole a visit to his master, and brought him
as much raw meat, hydromel, and spirits, as, more than once, threw
him into a fever and violent delirium. Luckily I was early informed
of this by the servant that was recovered, and who did not doubt but
this was to end in his master's death, as it very probably might
have done; but, by the interposition of Ayto Aylo and the Iteghé, we
got the unworthy subject banished to Maitsha, so that Welled Amlac
remained attended by the servant who had been sick with him, and was
to be trusted.

Not to trouble the reader with uninteresting particulars, Shalaka
Welled Amlac at last recovered after several weeks illness. When he
first came to my house he was but very indifferently cloathed, which,
in a sick man, was a thing not to be remarked. As he had no change of
raiment, his cloaths naturally grew worse during the time he staid
with me; and, indeed, he was a very beggarly sight when his disease
had entirely left him. One evening, when I was remarking that he could
not go home without kissing the ground before the Iteghé, he said,
Surely not, and he was ready to go whenever I should think proper
to bring him his cloaths. I understood at first from this, that he
might have brought some change of cloaths, and delivered them into my
servant's custody; but, upon farther explanation, I found he had not a
rag but those upon his back; and he told me plainly, that he had much
rather stay in my house all his life, than be so disgraced before the
world, as to leave it after so long a stay, without my first having
cloathed him from head to foot; asking me, with much confidence, What
signifies your curing me, if you turn me out of your house like a
beggar?

I still thought there was something of jest in this; and meeting Ayto
Aylo that day at Koscam, I told him, laughing, of the conversation
that had passed, and was answered gravely, "There is no doubt, you
must cloath him; to be sure it is the custom." "And his servant,
too?" said I. "Certainly, his servant too; and if he had ten servants
that ate and drank in your house, you most cloath them all." "I
think, said I, Ayto Aylo, a physician at this rate had much better
let his patients die than recover them at his own expence." "Yagoube,
says Aylo, I see this is not a custom in your country, but it is
invariably one in this: it is not so among the lower set of people;
but if you will pass here as a man of some degree of consequence, you
cannot avoid this without making Welled Amlac your enemy: the man
is opulent; it is not for the value of the cloaths, but he thinks
his importance among his neighbours is measured by the respect shewn
him by people afar off; never fear, he will make you some kind of
return, and for the cloaths I shall pay for them." "By no means, said
I, my good friend; I think the anecdote and custom is so curious
that it is worth the price of the cloaths; and I beg that you would
believe, that, intending to go through Maitsha, I consider it as a
piece of friendship in you to have brought me under this obligation."
"And so it is, says he: I knew you would think so; you are a cool
dispassionate man, and walk by advice, and do not break through the
customs of the country, and this reconciles even bad men to you every
day, and so much the longer shall you be in safety."

The reader will not doubt that I immediately fulfilled my obligation
to Welled Amlac, who received his cloaths, a girdle, and a pair of
sandals, in all to the amount of about two guineas, with the same
indifference as if he had been buying them for ready money. He then
asked for his servant's cloaths, which were ready for him. He only
said he thought they were too good, and hinted as if he should take
them for his own use when he went to Maitsha. I then carried him
new-dressed to the Iteghé, who gave him strict injunctions to take
care of me if ever I should come into his hands. He after went home
with Ayto Aylo, nor did I ever know what was become of him till now,
when we arrived at his house at Welled Abea Abbo, unless from some
words that fell in discourse from Fasil at Bamba.

Shalaka Welled Amlac was, however, from home, but his wife, mother,
and sisters, received us kindly, knowing us by report; and, without
waiting for our landlord, a cow was instantly slaughtered.

The venerable mistress of this worthy family, Welled Amlac's mother,
was a very stout, chearful woman, and bore no signs of infirmity
or old age: his wife was, on the contrary, as arrant a hag as ever
acted the part on the stage; very active, however, and civil, and
speaking very tolerable Amharic. His two sisters, about sixteen or
seventeen, were really handsome; but Fasil's wife, who was there,
was the most beautiful and graceful of them all; she seemed not to
be past eighteen, tall, thin, and of a very agreeable carriage and
manners. The features of her face were very regular; she had fine
eyes, mouth, and teeth, and dark-brown complexion; at first sight
a cast of melancholy seemed to hang upon her countenance, but this
soon vanished, and she became very courteous, chearful, and most
conversible of the whole, or at least seemed to wish to be so; for,
unfortunately, she spoke not a word of any language but Galla, though
she understood a little Amharic; our conversation did not fail to give
great entertainment to the whole family, and for her part, she laughed
beyond all measure.

The two sisters had been out helping my servants in disposing the
baggage; but when they had pitched my tent, and were about to lay the
mattress for sleeping on, the eldest of these interrupted them, and
not being able to make herself understood by the Greeks, she took it
up and threw it out of the tent-door, whilst no abuse or opprobrious
names were spared by my servants; one of whom came to tell me her
impudence, and that if they understood her, she said I was to sleep
with her this night, and they believed we were got into a house of
thieves and murderers. To this I answered by a sharp reproof, desiring
them to conform to every thing the family ordered them. I saw the
fair nymph was in a violent passion; she told her tale to the matrons
with great energy, and a volubility of tongue past imagination, and
they all laughed. Fasil's wife called me to sit by her, and began
to instruct me, drolly enough, as they do children, but of what she
said I had not the smallest guess. I endeavoured always to repeat her
last words, and this occasioned another vehement laugh, in which I
joined as heartily as any, to keep up the joke, for the benefit of the
company, as long as possible.

Immediately after this Welled Amlac arrived, and brought us the
disagreeable news, that it was impossible to proceed to the ford of
the Abay, as two of the neighbouring Shums were at variance about
their respective districts, and in a day or two would decide it by
blows. The faces of all our companions fell at these news; but as I
knew the man, it gave me little trouble, as I supposed the meaning to
be, that, if we made it worth while, he would accompany us himself,
and in that case we should pass without fear; at any rate, I well knew
that, after the obligations I had laid him under at Gondar, he could
not, consistent with the received usages of the country, if it was but
for his own reputation's sake, fail in receiving me in the very best
manner in his power, and entertaining me to the utmost all the time I
was in his house.

Satisfied that I understood him, he put on the most chearful
countenance: another cow was killed, great plenty of hydromel
produced, and he prepared to regale us as sumptuously as possible,
after the manner of the country. We were there, as often before,
obliged to overcome our repugnance to eating raw flesh. Shalaka Welled
Amlac set us the example, entertained us with the stories of his
hunting elephants, and feats in the last wars, mostly roguish ones.
The room where we were (which was indeed large, and contained himself,
mother, wife, sisters, his horses, mules, and servants, night and day)
was all hung round with the trunks of these elephants, which he had
brought from the neighbouring Kolla, near Guesgué, and killed with
his own hands, for he was one of the boldest and best horsemen in
Abyssinia, and perfectly master of his arms.

This Polyphemus's feast being finished, the horn of hydromel
went briskly about. Welled Amlac's eldest sister, whose name was
Melectanea, took a particular charge of me, and I began to find the
necessity of retiring and going to bed while I was able. Here the
former story came over again; the invariable custom of all Maitsha and
the country of the Galla, of establishing a relationship by sleeping
with a near of kin, was enlarged upon; and, as the young lady herself
was present, and presented every horn of drink during this polite
dispute concerning her person, I do not know whether it will not be
thought a greater breach of delicacy to have refused than to have
complied:--

    But what success Vanessa met
    Is to the world a secret yet;
    Can never to mankind be told,
    Nor shall the conscious muse unfold.

Fye upon the conscious muse, says lord Orrery; and fye, too, say I:--a
man of honour and gallantry should not permit himself such a hint as
this, though the Red Sea was between him and his mistress.

It was impossible to sleep; the whole night was one continued storm of
thunder, rain, and lightning; the morning was clearer, and my people
very urgent to go away; but I had still to settle with Zor Woldo,
who had been kept by his mistress, Fasil's wife, notwithstanding
his master's orders, till he had told her the whole circumstances
of our expedition, and made her laugh heartily at the oddity of our
sentiments and customs. This she repaid to him by plentiful horns of
mead and bouza, as also large collops of raw meat, which made him a
very eloquent historian; whether or no he was a faithful one, I cannot
possibly judge.

After having settled with him to his perfect satisfaction, and
cancelled entirely the memory of some disagreeable things passed, he
consigned us very solemnly to Ayto Aylo's servant, in presence of
Welled Amlac, and had taken his leave, when a very fine white cow was
brought to the door of the tent from Fasil's wife, who insisted, as a
friend of her husband, that I would stay that day for her sake; and I
should either learn her my language, or she would teach me Galla. The
party was accepted as soon as offered; the morning was fresh and cool,
nor had last night's libation any way disordered my stomach. Strates
himself, though afraid of Welled Amlac, and exceedingly exasperated at
the impudent behaviour, as he called it, of Melectanea, was, however,
a little pacified at the approach of the white cow. Brother, says he
to Michael, we have nothing to do with people's manners as long as
they are civil to us: as to this house, there is no doubt but the men
are robbers and murderers, and their women wh--es; but if they use us
well while we are now here, and we are so lucky as to get to Gondar
alive, let the devil take me if ever I seek again to be at Welled Abea
Abbo. It was agreed to relax that day, and dedicate it to herborizing,
as also to the satisfying the curiosity of our female friends, by
answering all their questions; and thus the forenoon passed as
agreeable as possible.

Welled Amlac, a great hunter, had gone with me early to a neighbouring
thicket on horseback, armed with lances in search of venison, though
we certainly did not want provisions. We in a few minutes raised two
bohur, a large animal of the deer kind, and each pursued his beast;
mine had not run 400 yards before I overtook him, and pierced him with
my pike; and the same would have happened probably to the other, had
not Welled Amlac's horse put his fore-feet into a fox's hole, which
threw him and his rider headlong to the ground; he was not, however,
hurt, but rose very gravely, and desired me to return; it being a rule
among these people, never to persist when any thing unfortunate falls
out in the beginning of a day.

Our company was now increased by our former landlord at Goutto, where
we were obliged to Woldo's stratagem for discovering the cow that was
hid. We sat down chearfully to dinner. Welled Amlac's fall had not
spoiled his appetite; I think he ate equal to four ordinary men. I,
for the most part, ate the venison, which was made into an excellent
dish, only too much stuffed with all kind of spices. Fasil's wife
alone seemed to have a very poor appetite, notwithstanding her violent
fits of laughter, and outward appearance of chearfulness. A melancholy
gloom returned upon her beautiful face, that seemed to indicate a mind
not at ease. She was of a noble family of Galla, which had conquered
and settled in the low country of Narea. I wondered that Fasil her
husband had not carried her to Gondar. She said her husband had twenty
other wives besides her, but took none of them to Gondar; which was
a place of war, where it was the custom to marry the wives of their
enemies that they had forced to fly, Fasil will be married therefore
to Michael's wife, Ozoro Esther. I could not help being startled at
this declaration, remembering that I was here losing my time, and
forgetting my word of returning as soon as possible; but we had, for
many months, lived in such constant alarms, that it was absolutely as
needful to seize the moment in which we could repose our mind, as to
give rest to the body.

In the afternoon we distributed our presents among the ladies. Fasil's
wife was not forgot; and the beautiful Melectanea was covered with
beads, handkerchiefs, and ribbands of all colours. Fasil's wife, on my
first request, gave me a lock of her fine hair from the root, which
has ever since, and at this day does suspend a plummet of an ounce
and half at the index of my three-feet quadrant.

The next morning, the 13th of November, having settled our account
with our host, we set out from the hospitable house of Shalaka Welled
Amlac, after having engaged, by promises to the ladies, that we should
pay them soon another visit. Our landlord accompanied us in person to
the ford, and by this, and his readiness to shew us what he thought
worthy of our curiosity, and by his care in ascertaining for us the
distances and situations of places, he gave us a certain proof he was
well contented, and therefore that we had nothing to fear.

We had both nights heard the noise of cataracts, and we thought it
might be of the Nile, as we were in fact but five miles from the
second small cataract at Kerr, which lay W. S. W. of us. We were
informed, however, in the morning, that it was the sound of falls in
the river Jemma, near whose banks this house is situated. We set out
at eight o'clock, the hills of Aroossi bearing north; and at half past
eight we came to the ford of the Jemma, which is strong, rugged, and
uneven.

The Jemma here comes from the east; its banks are most beautifully
shaded with acacia and other trees, growing as on the west of the
Nile, that is, the trunks or stems of the trees at a distance, but
the tops touching each other, and spreading broad. Though growing to
no height, these woods are full of game of different kinds, mostly
unknown in Europe. The bohur is here in great numbers; also the
Buffalo, though not so frequent. Whoever sees Richmond hill has an
idea of the banks of the Jemma, and the country east of it, with all
that addition that an eastern and happier climate can give it; for the
rains had now ceased, and every hill was in flower; the sun indeed was
hot, but a constant and fresh breeze prevented its being felt near the
river. The heat in this country ceases, in the warmest day, the moment
we pass from the sun to the shade: we have none of these hot winds or
violent reflections which we had suffered in Egypt, Syria, and Arabia,
and both the coasts of the Red Sea.

There are two cataracts lower than this ford of the Jemma, the first
about 300 yards below the ford, and another larger, something about
half a mile; it is not, however, more than seven or eight feet high,
perhaps about ninety feet broad, and the sheet of water is not
entire, but is interrupted in many places. It falls, however, into a
magnificent bason above 400 yards square, and very deep, in which are
large fish in great plenty, but no crocodiles; nor indeed are there
any seen, as I have heard above the third cataract, nor considerably
below, when, after having made the tour of Gojam, it again turns
northward towards its sources. The Gomari, however, often comes to
the mouth of the Jemma, especially when the first rains fall; the
crocodile seems to require a warmer climate.

After having satisfied our curiosity as to the Jemma, I began to
reproach those that were with me about the panic which they felt
the night before; these were, a Greek of Gondar, Strates, and three
others, my servants, whom I brought from Cairo. "You see, said I,
what danger there is; Welled Amlac is with us upon a mule, without
a lance or shield, and only two naked servants with him; did not I
tell you what was the meaning of the news?" Though this was spoken in
a language of which it was impossible Amlac could know a syllable,
yet he presently apprehended in part what I would say. "I see, says
he, you believe what I told you last night to be false, and invented
only to get from you a present: but you shall see; and if this day
we do not meet Welled Aragawi and his soldiers, you are then in the
right; it is as you imagine."--"You do me wrong, said I, and have not
understood me, for how should you. Those white people believe too well
all you told them, and are only apprehensive of your not being able
to defend us, being without arms and followers. All I said was, that
where you were, armed or unarmed, there was no danger."--"True, says
he, you are now in Maitsha, and not in my country, which is Goutto;
you are now in the worst country in all Abyssinia, where the brother
kills his brother for a loaf of bread, of which he has no need: you
are in a country of Pagans, or dogs, Galla, and worse than Galla;
if ever you meet an _old man_ here, he is a stranger; all that are
natives die by the lance young; and yet, though these two chieftains
I mentioned fight to-day, unarmed as I am, (as you well said) you are
in no danger while I am with you. These people of Maitsha, shut up
between the Jemma, the Nile, and the lake, have no where but from the
Agows to get what they want; they come to the same market with us here
in Goutto; the fords of the Jemma, they know, are in my hands; and did
they offer an injury to a friend of mine, were it but to whistle as he
passed them, they know I am not gentle; though not a Galla, they are
sensible, one day or other, I should call them to account, though it
were in the bed-chamber of their master Fasil."

"Your master, Welled Amlac, with your leave," said I. "Yes, mine too,
said he, by force, but he never shall be my master by inclination,
after murdering Kasmati Eshté. He calls me his brother, and believes
me his friend. You saw one of his wives, whom he leaves at my house,
last night, but I hope still to see him and his Galla slaughtered as
the cow in my house was yesterday." "I am surprised, said I, your
house was spared, and that Ras Michael did not burn it in either of
his passages through Maitsha."--"In 1769, replied he, I was not with
Fasil at Fagitta, and the Ras passed the Nile above this far beyond
the Kelti; after which I returned with him to Gondar. In Ginbot[2],
Fasil informed us that Amhara and Begemder were come over to him.
When then all Maitsha joined Fasil, I went with my people to meet
Michael at Derdera, as I knew he must pass the Nile here opposite to
Abbo, and Begemder and Amhara would then be behind him, or else try to
cross at Delakus, which was then swollen with rain, and unfordable:
but apprehensive lest, marching still higher up along the Nile to
find a ford, he might burn my house in his way, I myself joined him
the night before he knew of Powussen's revolt, and he had it then
in contemplation to burn Samseen. The next morning was that of his
retreat, and he chose me to accompany him across the Nile, still
considering me as his friend, and therefore, perhaps, he would have
done no harm to my house."--"So it was you, said I, that led us that
day into that cursed clay-hole, which you call a ford, where so many
people and beasts were maimed and lost?"--He replied, "It was Fasil's
spies that first persuaded him to pass there, or at Kerr. I kept him
to the place where you passed; you would have all perished at Kerr.
This, to be sure, was not a good ford, nor passable at all except in
summer, unless by swimming; but so many men crossing had made it still
worse; besides, do you remember what a storm it was?--what a night of
rain? O Lady Mariam, always a virgin, said I, while they struggled in
the mud and clay. O holy Abba Guebra Menfus Kedus, who never ate or
drank from his mother's womb till his death, will you not open the
earth, that all this accursed multitude may descend alive into hell,
like Dathan and Abiram?"--A kind and charitable prayer!--"I thank
you for it, Welled Amlac, said I; first, for carrying us to that
charitable ford, where, with one of the strongest and ablest horses in
the world, I had nearly perished:--and, secondly, for your pious wish,
to dispose of us out of the regions of rain and cold into so warm
quarters in company with Dathan and Abiram!"

"I did not know you was there, says he; I heard you had staid at
Gondar in order to bring up the black horse. I saw a white person[3]
with the Ras, indeed, who had a good hanjar and gun, but his mule
was weak, and he himself seemed sick. As I returned I could have
carried him off in the night, but I said, perhaps it is the brother
of Yagoube, my friend and physician; he is white like him, and for
your sake I left him. I was much with you white people in the time of
Kasmati Eshté."--"And pray, said I, what did you after we passed the
Abay?"--"After I saw that devil Ras Michael over, said Welled Amlac,
I returned under pretence of assisting Kefla Yasous there, and,
being joined by all my people, we fell upon the stragglers wherever
we found them. You know what a day of rain it was; we took 17 guns,
12 horses, and about 200 mules and asses laden, and so returned home,
leaving the rest to Fasil, who, if he had been a man, should have cut
you all to pieces the day after."--"And what did you, said I, with
these stragglers whom you met and robbed; did you kill them?"--"We
always kill them, answered Amlac; we spare none; we never do a man
an injury, and leave him alive to revenge it upon us after; but it
was really the same; they were all sick and weak, and the hyæna would
have finished them in the morning, so it was just saving them so much
suffering to kill them outright the night before; and I assure you,
Yagoube, whatever you may think, I did not do it out of malice."--From
this conversation one may sufficiently guess what sort of a man Welled
Amlac was, and what were his ideas of mercy.

We passed the church of Kedus Michael at half after nine, on the road
to our right. At nine and three quarters our course was N. by W. and,
at a quarter after ten, we passed the Coga, a large river. At three
quarters past ten our course was north. We passed the church of Abbo a
quarter of a mile on our right. The country, after we had crossed the
Jemma, was much less beautiful than before. At twelve our course was
N. by W. and at half past twelve the church of Mariam Net, 200 yards
to the left; and here we forded the small river Amlac-Ohha. Every
step of this ground put us in mind of our disastrous campaign in May;
and we were now passing directly in the tract of the ever-memorable
retreat of Kefla Yasous and the rear of the army. At a quarter after
one we halted at a small village of low houses, as it were in bent
grass, where, for the first time, we saw flocks of goats lying on the
tops of the houses for fear of wild beasts.

"You shall see, says Welled Amlac, whether I am telling truth or not;
this is the house of Welled Aragawi; if he is here at home, then I
have deceived you." We saw a number of women laden with jars of bouza
and hydromel, and asked where they were going. They said to their
master at Delakus, who waited there to prevent Welleta Michael of
Degwassa from passing the river. Our Greeks on this began to relapse
into their panic, and to wish we were again at Welled Abea Abbo. At
three quarters past one we continued our journey to the north, and
passed a river, called Amlac-Ohha, larger than the former: it comes
from the east, and, half a mile further, receives the other stream
already mentioned. The sun was now burning hot. At three o'clock we
halted a quarter of an hour; and, beginning to descend gently, an
hour after this we came to the banks of the Abay. Here we saw the two
combatants, Welleta Michael and Welled Aragawi, exactly opposite to
each other, the first on the west the other on the east side; they had
settled all their differences, and each had killed several kine for
themselves and friends, which was all the blood shed that day.

The Nile is here a considerable river; its breadth at this time full
three quarters of an English mile; the current is very gentle; where
deep you scarce can perceive it flow; it comes from W. by S. and W.
S. W. and at the ford runs east and west. The banks on the east side
were very high and steep; and on the west, at the first entrance, the
bottom is soft and bad, the water four feet and a half deep, but
above another foot, which we sink in clay. I cried to Welled Amlac,
while he was leading my mule across, that he should not pray to his
saint that never eats, as at the passage of the Jemma in May. He only
answered lowly to me, Do you think these thieves would have let you
pass if I was not with you? My answer was, Welleta Michael would not
have seen me wronged; I saved his life, he and every body knows it.

We gained with difficulty the middle of the river, where the bottom
was firm, and there we rested a little. Whilst we were wading near the
other side, we found foul ground, but the water was shallow, and the
banks low and easy to ascend. The river side, as far as we could see,
is bare and destitute of wood of any kind, only bordered with thistles
and high grass, and the water tinged deep with red earth, of which its
banks are composed. This passage is called Delakus, and is passable
from the end of October to the middle of May. Immediately on the top
of the hill ascending from the river is the small town of Delakus,
which gives this ford its name; it extends from N. E. to N. N. E. and
is more considerable in appearance than is the generality of these
small towns or villages in Abyssinia, because inhabited by Mahometans
only, a trading, frugal, intelligent, and industrious people.

Our conductor, Welled Amlac, again put us in mind of the service
he had rendered us, and we were not unmindful of him. He had been
received with very great respect by the eastern body of combatants,
and it is incredible with what expedition he swallowed near a pound
of raw flesh cut from the buttocks of the animal yet alive. After
some horns of hydromel, he had passed to the other side, where he was
received with still more affection, if possible, by Welleta Michael,
and there he began again to eat the raw meat with an appetite as keen
as if he had fasted for whole days; he then consigned us to Ayto
Welleta Michael, his friend and mine, who furnished us with a servant
to conduct us on our way, while he himself remained that night at
the ford among the combatants. He advised us to advance as far as
possible, for all that country was destroyed by a malignant fever
which laid all waste beyond Delakus.

We left the ford at a quarter past five in the evening, and, pursuing
our journey north, we passed the small town of Delakus, continuing
along the hill among little spots of brush-wood and small fields of
corn intermixed. At half past six passed the river Avola. At half past
seven crossed another swift-running stream, clear and shallow, but
full of slippery stones. At three quarters after seven we alighted at
Googue, a considerable village, and, as it was now night, we could go
no farther; we had already several times mistaken our way, and lost
each other in the dark, being often also mired in a small plain before
we passed the last river; but our guide had heard the orders of his
master, and pushed on briskly.

We found the people of Googue the most savage and unhospitable we had
yet met with. Upon no account would they suffer us to enter their
houses, and we were obliged to remain without, the greatest part of
the night. At last they carried us to a house of good appearance, but
refused absolutely to give us meat for ourselves or horses; and,
as we had not force, we were obliged to be content. It had rained
violently in the evening, and we were all wet. We contented ourselves
with lighting a large fire in the middle of the house, which we kept
burning all night, as well for guard, as for drying ourselves, though
we little knew at the time that it was probably the only means of
saving our lives; for in the morning we found the whole village sick
of the fever, and two families had died out of the house where these
people had put us: for my own part, upon hearing this I was more
affrighted than for Welled Aragawi and all his robbers. Though weary
and wet, I had slept on the ground near the fire six whole hours; and,
tho' really well, I could not during the day persuade myself there was
not some symptom of fever upon me. My first precaution was to infuse
a dose of bark into a glass of aquavitæ, a large horn of which we
had with us; we then burnt frankincense and myrrh in abundance, and
fumigated ourselves, as practised at Masuah and in Arabia. Early in
the morning we repeated our dose of bark and fumigation. Whether the
bark prevented the disease or not, the aquavitæ certainly strengthened
the spirits, and was a medicine to the imagination.

The people, who saw the eagerness and confidence with which we
swallowed this medicine, flocked about us demanding assistance.
I confess I was so exasperated with their treatment of us, and
especially that of lodging us in the infected house, that I constantly
refused them their request, leaving them a prey to their distemper, to
teach them another time more hospitality to strangers.

This fever prevailed in Abyssinia in all low grounds and plains, in
the neighbourhood of all rivers which run in valleys; it is really
a malignant tertian, which, however, has so many forms and modes of
intermission that it is impossible for one not of the Faculty to
describe it. It is not in all places equally dangerous, but on the
banks and neighbourhood of the Tacazzé it is particularly fatal. The
valley where that river runs is very low and sultry, being full of
large trees. In Kuara, too, it is very mortal; in Belessen and Dembea
less so; in Walkayt it is dangerous; but not so much in Tzegadè,
Kolla, Woggora, and Waldubba. It does not prevail in high grounds or
mountains, or in places much exposed to the air. This fever is called
Nedad, or burning; it begins always with a shivering and headache,
a heavy eye, and inclination to vomit; a violent heat follows, which
leaves little intermission, and ends generally in death the third or
fifth day. In the last stage of the distemper the belly swells to an
enormous size, or sometimes immediately after death, and the body
within an instant smells most insupportably; to prevent which they
bury the corpse immediately after the breath is out, and often within
the hour. The face has a remarkable yellow appearance, with a blackish
cast, as in the last stage of a dropsy or the atrophy. This fever
begins immediately with the sun-shine, after the first rains, that is,
while there are intervals of rain and sun-shine: it ceases upon the
earth being thoroughly soaked in July and August, and begins again in
September; but now, at the beginning of November, it finally ceases
everywhere.

The country about Googue is both fertile and pleasant, all laid out
in wheat, and the grain good. They were now in the midst of their
harvest, but there were some places, to which the water could be
conducted, where the corn was just appearing out of the ground.
From Googue we have an extensive view of the lake Tzana, whilst the
mountains of Begemder and Karoota, that is, all the ridge along
Foggora, appear distinctly enough, but they are sunk low, and near the
horizon.

On the 14th, at three quarters past seven in the morning, we left
the inhospitable village Googue; our road lay N. by W. up a small
hill. At half past eight we crossed the village of Azzadari, in which
runs a small river, then almost stagnant, of the same name. At three
quarters after eight, the church of Turcon Abbo, being a quarter of a
mile to our right. At three quarters after nine we passed the river
Avolai, coming from N. W. and which, with all the other streams above
mentioned, fall into the lake: from this begins Degwassa. At half
past ten we rested half an hour. At eleven continued our journey N.
by W. and, at half after eleven, entered again into the great road
of Buré, by Kelti. All the country from Googue is bare, unpleasant,
unwholesome, and ill watered. Those few streams it has are now
standing in pools, and are probably stagnant in January and February.
The people, too, are more miserable than in any other part of Maitsha
and Goutto.

As we are now leaving Maitsha, it will be the place to say something
concerning it in particular. Maitsha is either proper, or what is
called so by extension. Maitsha Proper is bounded on the west by
the Nile, on the south by the river Jemma, dividing it from Goutto;
and, on the other side of Amid Amid, by the province of Damot; on
the south by Gojam; on the east and north by the Abay or Nile, and
the lake: this is Maitsha proper; but by extension it comprehends a
large tract on the west side of the Nile, which begins by Sankraber
on the north, and is bounded by the Agows on the west, comprehending
Atcheffer and Aroossi to the banks of the Nile. This is the Maitsha of
the books, but is not properly so.

Maitsha is governed by ninety-nine Shums, and is an appendage of the
office of Betwudet, to whom it pays two thousand ounces of gold. The
people are originally of those Galla west of the Abay. Yasous the
Great, when at war with that people, who, in many preceding reigns,
had laid waste the provinces of Gojam and Damot, and especially
Agow, when he passed the Abay found these people at variance among
themselves; and the king, who was everywhere victorious, being joined
by the weakest, advanced to Narea, and, on his return, transplanted
these Galla into Maitsha, placing part of them along the Nile to guard
the passes. His successors at different times followed his example;
part they settled in Maitsha, and part along the banks of the Nile in
Damot and Gojam, where being converted to Christianity, at least to
such Christianity as is professed in Abyssinia, they have increased
exceedingly, and amounted, at least before the war in 1768, to 15,000
men, of whom about 4000 are horsemen.

The capital of Maitsha is Ibaba. There is here a house or small
castle belonging to the king. The town is one of the largest in
Abyssinia, little inferior to Gondar in size or riches, and has a
market every day; this is governed by an officer called Ibaba Azage,
whose employment is worth 600 ounces of gold, and is generally
conferred upon the principal person of Maitsha, to keep him firm in
his allegiance, as there is a very considerable territory depends upon
this office. The country round Ibaba is the most pleasant and fertile,
not of Maitsha only, but of all Abyssinia, especially that part called
Kollela, between Ibaba and Gojam, where the principal Ozoros have
all houses and possessions, called Goult or Fiefs, which they have
received from their respective ancestors when kings.

Though Maitsha be peculiarly the appendage of Betwudet, and governed
by him, yet it has a particular political government of its own.
The ninety-nine Shums, who are each a distinct family of Galla,
chuse a king, like the Pagan Galla, every seventh year, with all
the ceremonies anciently observed while they were Pagans; and
these governors have much more influence over them than the King
or Betwudet; so have they (in my time at least) been in a constant
rebellion, and that has much lessened their numbers, which will
not now amount to above 10,000 men, Ras Michael having every where
destroyed their houses, and carried into slavery their wives and
children, who have been sold to the Mahometan merchants, and
transported to Masuah, and from thence to Arabia.

At twelve o'clock, Guesgué was to the right, three or four, perhaps
more miles; and the very rugged mountain Cafercla, broken and full of
precipices, on our right, at about 12 miles distance; they rise from
Kolla. Guesgué, which, though the language and race be Agow, is not
comprehended in the government of that country, but generally goes
with Kuara. At a quarter past one we arrived at the house of Ayto
Welleta Michael, at Degwassa, after entering into a country something
more pleasant and cultivated than the former. The village of Degwassa
is but small; it had also been burnt in the late war; it is pleasantly
situated on a hill south of the lake, about 3 miles distance, and
is surrounded with large wanzey-trees; we were but ill-received at
this village, notwithstanding the promises of the master of it at
the passage of the Abay, and we found these people scarcely more
hospitable than at Googue. This village is a little out of the road,
to the right. We had travelled this day five hours and a half, or
little more than ten miles.

On the 15th of November, from Degwassa we entered Gonzala, immediately
bordering upon it: heavy rain prevented our setting out till noon.
Gonzala is full of villages, and belongs to the queen-mother. At a
quarter after one we passed a large marsh, in the midst of which runs
a small river which here falls into the lake. We rested here half an
hour; and, at three quarters past one, we entered the great road which
we had passed to the left in going to Degwassa. At two o'clock we came
still to a distincter view of the lake, as also where the river enters
and goes out; it appears here to enter at S. W. and go out at N. E.
and is distant about eight or nine miles. At three quarters past two,
we arrived at Dingleber, having this day travelled only two hours and
a half, or five miles.

On the 16th we left Dingleber at seven o'clock in the morning; it was
very hot; and, a little before we came to Mescalaxos, in a stripe of
land, or peninsula, which runs out into the lake, we halted a short
time under the shade of some acacia-trees. Here we saw plenty of
water-fowl, and several gomaris. A small river crosses the road here,
and falls into the lake: and, at one o'clock in the afternoon, we
continued our journey, and overtook a troop of Agows, who were going
to Gondar, laden with honey, butter, and untanned hides. They had with
them also about 800 head of cattle. These people accustomed to the
road (though heavily laden) go long journies: they had at this time 50
miles to make by nine o'clock in the morning of the 18th, and it was
now the 16th, past one o'clock.

A Shower overtook us soon after passing Mescalaxos, and forced us to
take refuge in some small huts near the lake, called Goja, where we
remained. The inhabitants of this and the neighbouring villages speak
Falasha, the language anciently of all Dembea, which, as has been
already observed, in most of the plain country, has now given place
to Amharic. Here we saw two gomari come out of the lake and enter the
corn, but speedily, upon the dogs of the villages attacking them, they
ran and plunged into the water; we could not have a distinct view of
them, nor time enough to design them, but they were very different
from any draught we had ever seen of them. The head seemed to me to
resemble that of a hog more than of a horse. We had this day travelled
six hours and a half, or about thirteen miles.

On the 17th, at a quarter past seven, we left Goja. At one o'clock
we halted at Sar Ohha, after a journey of five hours and a half, or
about eleven miles; and on the 18th, at half past six, left Sar Ohha.
At three quarters past seven we passed the river Talti, and at half
past eleven halted at Abba Abram, near the church, under a large
sassa-tree. At one, continued our journey, and at a quarter past two
arrived at Kemona.

On the 19th of November, at seven in the morning, we left Kemona, and
going constantly without stopping by Chergué and Azazo, I sent my
servants and baggage on to Abba Samuel at Gondar, where they arrived
at one o'clock afternoon, and finished our long-projected expedition,
or journey, to the fountains of the Nile, having, in our return home,
made as it were the chord of the arch of our former journey, or about
ninety-three miles, with which we found our points, as settled by
observation, did very nearly agree.

Two things chiefly occupied my mind, and prevented me from
accompanying my servants and baggage into Gondar. The first was my
desire of instantly knowing the state of Ozoro Esther's health: the
second was, to avoid Fasil, till I knew a little more about Ras
Michael and the king. Taking one servant along with me, I left my
people at Azazo, and turning to the left, up a very craggy, steep
mountain, I made the utmost diligence I could till I arrived at the
gate of Koscam, near two o'clock, without having met any one from
Fasil, who was encamped opposite to Gondar, on the Kahha, on the
side of the hill, so that I had passed obliquely behind him. He had,
however, seen or heard of the arrival of my servants at Gondar,
and had sent for me to wait upon him in his camp; and, when he was
informed I had gone forward to Koscam, it was said he had uttered some
words of discontent.

I went straight to the Iteghé's apartment, but was not admitted, as
she was at her devotions. In crossing one of the courts, however, I
met a slave of Ozoro Esther, who, instead of answering the question
I put to her, gave a loud shriek, and went to inform her mistress. I
found that princess greatly recovered, as her anxiety about Fasil had
ceased. She had admitted him to an audience, and he had communicated
to her the engagement he was under to her husband, as also the conduct
he intended to pursue in order to keep Gusho and Powussen from taking
any effectual measures which might frustrate, or at least delay, the
restoration of the king and arrival of Ras Michael.

   _Fasil's insidious Behaviour--Arrival at Gondar--King passes the
   Taccazzé--Iteghé and Socinios fly from Gondar._


I shall now resume the history of Abyssinia itself, so far as I was
concerned in it, or had an opportunity of knowing, and this I shall
follow as closely as possible, till I begin my return home through
those dreary and hitherto-unknown deserts of Sennaar, though not the
most entertaining, yet by far the most dangerous and most difficult
part of the voyage.

It was about the 20th of October that Woodage Asahel came with a
strong body of horse into the neighbourhood of Gondar, and cut off all
communication between the capital and those provinces to the southward
of it. This occasioned a temporary famine, as his troops plundered all
those they met on the road carrying provisions to the market. At first
he refused to tell what his real errand was; but, a few days after,
having passed the low country of Dembea, he took post at Dingleber, on
the road to Maitsha and the country of the Agows, and then he declared
his only intention in coming was to join Fasil, then marching to
Gondar at the head of a large army; nor was the cause of that great
army, nor the reason of Fasil's coming, so sufficiently known as to
free any party entirely from their apprehensions.

Sanuda, who filled the office of Ras, and the rest of that party,
endeavoured to determine Asahel to enter Gondar, and pay his homage
to Socinios, now king; not doubting but his example would have the
effect of making others do the like, and that so by degrees they might
collect troops enough to make Michael respect them, so far at least as
to defer for a season his march from Tigrè. They prevailed, indeed, so
far as to engage Asahel to enter Gondar on the 28th of October, the
day that we left it; so, by a few hours, and his taking a low road
that he might plunder the villages in Dembea, we missed a meeting of
the most dangerous and most disagreeable kind. After having made his
usual parade, and passed his cavalry in review before Socinios, he had
his public audience, where he said he came charged by Fasil to declare
that he was ready to set out for Gondar, and bring with him that
part of the revenue due to the king from the provinces he commanded,
provided he had a man of sufficient trust to leave in his stead at
home; that therefore he prayed the king to appoint him Woodage Asahel
to command in the provinces of Damot, Maitsha, and Agow, in his
absence.

After the many promises and engagements Fasil had made and broken,
without ever assigning the smallest reason, it may be doubted whether
Socinios believed this fair tale implicitly; but his present intention
being to gain Woodage, it little signified whether it was strictly
true or not; he therefore received it as true. Fasil's request was
granted to the full; and this robber, twenty times a rebel, bred
up in woods and deserts, in exercise of every crime, was appointed
to a command the third in the kingdom for rank, power, and riches;
and, what was never before seen, the king went out of his palace to
Deppabye, the public market-place, to see the circle of gold, called
the Ras Werk, put upon his head; this, with the white and blue mantle,
invests him with the dignity of Kasmati, or lieutenant-general of the
king, in the province given him.

A low man, such as Asahel was, could not resist the caresses of his
sovereign; he was entirely gained; and, in return, made privately to
Socinios, and a few confidants, a communication of all he knew, which
their natural imprudence, and private previous engagements, afterwards
made public. The substance of this confidence was, that peace had been
made and sworn to, in the most solemn manner, both by Michael and
Fasil; that they were to restore the king, Tecla Haimanout; that they
were, by their joint means, to effect, if possible, the ruin of Gusho
and Powussen, governors of Begemder and Amhara; Fasil was to enjoy the
post of Ras and Betwuder, and to dispose of the government of Begemder
and Amhara to his friends; Ras Michael was to content himself with
the province of Tigrè, as he then enjoyed it, and advance no further
than the river Tacazzé, where he was to deliver the king to Fasil,
and return to his province. Sanuda was, in the mean time, to appear
as Ras by the connivance of Fasil and Michael; and, if he saw the
people of the Iteghé's party resolved upon electing a king, he was to
take care to choose such a one as would soon prove himself incapable
of reigning, but fill the vacancy in the mean time, and prevent the
election from falling upon a worthier candidate from the mountain of
Wechné. Fasil, on his part, undertook by promises and proposals, and
occasionally by the approach of his army, to frighten and confuse the
Iteghé, and prevent a good understanding taking place between her,
Gusho, and Powussen. The last article of this treaty was, that no
more should be said of Joas the late king's murderer, but all that
transaction was to be buried in eternal oblivion. This peace, Asahel
had said, was made by the mediation of Welleta Selassé, nephew of Ras
Michael, whom we have often mentioned as having been taken prisoner by
Fasil at the battle of Limjour.

This discovery, dangerous as it might have been in other times and
circumstances, from the weakness of the present government, had no
consequences hurtful to any concerned in it. Sanuda, who was not
present when Asahel revealed the secret, affected to laugh at it as
an improbable fiction; and though this whole scheme of treachery
was confirmed part by part, yet it was so deeply laid, and so well
supported, that, even when discovered, it could not be prevented,
till, step by step, it was carried into execution.

Fasil was encamped at Bamba, as we have already mentioned; he had
discharged all those savage Galla that he had brought from the other
side of the Nile. As soon as he had heard in how favourable a manner
Woodage Asahel had been received, he decamped, taking with him 400
horse and 600 foot, all chosen men, from Maitsha and Damot, and with
these he advanced, by forced marches, to Gondar, where he arrived
the 2d of November, to the surprise of the whole town and court, for
he had already so often promised, and so often broken his word, that
nobody pretended to guess more about him till they actually saw him
arrived. That same evening he waited on the queen, where he made a
short visit; he paid a still shorter to the king, and no business
passed at either of these meetings.

The king, Socinios, was now more than ever confirmed in the belief
of Asahel's information, because, notwithstanding that Fasil knew
perfectly his necessities, and that for seven years he had not paid
a farthing to the revenue, he still had not brought either payment,
or present of any sort; and, instead of coming with a large army to
give battle to Ras Michael, he arrived as in peace with scarce a body
guard; and, what seemed to put the matter beyond all doubt, the very
night of his arrival, upon coming from his audience, he set Welleta
Selassé at liberty, and sent him to Tigrè to his uncle Ras Michael,
loaded with many presents, and with every mark of respect. There were,
however, about Socinios some people of wisdom enough to counsel him
to take no notice of this behaviour of Fasil, which seemed to favour
strongly of defiance; and he was wise enough for a short time to
follow their advice. As he had, by fair means, gained Woodage Asahel,
he thought he might, by pursuing the same conduct, succeed with Fasil
also.

In the morning, therefore, of the 3d of November, without attempting
further discussion, proclamation was made that Fasil was Ras and
Betwudet, governor of Damot, Maitsha, and Agow, and had the disposal
of all places under the king throughout the empire; declaring also,
that all appointments that had been made by the Iteghé or himself, in
Fasil's absence, were null and void, to be again filled up by Fasil
only. Socinios, however, soon found that he had a different spirit
to manage than that of Woodage Asahel. Fasil took him at his word,
accepted of the appointment, began immediately to exercise his power,
and the very first day he gave the post of Cantiba, that is, governor
of Dembea, to Ayto Engedan, nephew to the queen-mother, and son to
Kasmati Eshté, whom he himself had deposed, murdered, and succeeded
in the government of Damot and Maitsha; and Selassé Barea, brother to
Ayto Aylo, he made Palambaras. These appointments just planted the
king in the difficulty that was intended; for the places had been
given to Kasmati Sanuda, as a recompence for resigning the posts of
Ras and Betwudet, which were now conferred upon Fasil; and Sanuda,
whom Socinios believed his only friend, and the person that raised him
to the throne, was now left destitute of all employment whatever, by
an act of seeming ingratitude flowing from the king alone.

The next day Fasil, pursuing the same line of conduct, appointed
Adera Tacca Georgis, a creature of his own, Fit-Auraris to the king.
None of these preferments Socinios could be brought to comply with;
so that when these noblemen came to do homage for their respective
places, Socinios absolutely refused to receive them, or displace
Kasmati Sanuda. This involved the king in still greater difficulties,
for he thereby broke his word with Fasil, who had done nothing more
than Socinios gave him authority to do. On the other hand, Selassé
Barea was brother to Ayto Aylo, the queen's greatest counsellor and
confident; equal to his brother both in wisdom, integrity, and riches,
and in the favour of the people, but much more ambitious and desirous
of governing, consequently more dangerous when disobliged.

Socinios, who did not believe that Sanuda was treacherously urging him
to his ruin, continued obstinate in rejecting Fasil's appointment,
and all fell immediately into confusion. Troops flocked in from every
quarter, as upon a signal given. Ayto Engedan, in discontent, with a
thousand men sat down near Gondar on the river Mogetch; his brother
Aylo, at Emfras, about 15 miles further, with double that number;
Ayto Confu, his cousin-german, with about 600 horse, lay above Koscam
for the protection of Ozoro Esther, his mother, and the Iteghé his
grandmother--all were in arms, though upon the defensive.

In this situation of things I arrived at Gondar on the 19th of
November, but could not see the queen, who had retired into her
apartment under pretence of devotion, but rather from disgust and
melancholy, at seeing that every thing, however the contrary might
be intended, seemed to conspire to bring about the return of Ras
Michael, the event in the world she dreaded most. I found with Ozoro
Esther the Acab Saat, Abba Salama, who, as we have already observed,
had excommunicated her uncle Kasmati Eshté, and afterwards contrived
his murder, and had also had a very principal share in that of Joas
himself. It was he that Fasil said had sent to him to desire that I
might not be allowed to proceed to the head of the Nile, and that from
no other reason but a hatred to me as a Frank. We bowed to each other
as two not very great friends, and he immediately began a very dry,
ill-natured, admonitory discourse, addressed, for the greatest part,
to Ozoro Esther, explaining to her the mischief of suffering Franks to
remain at liberty in the country and meddle in affairs. I interrupted
him by a laugh, and by saying, If it is me, father, you mean by the
word Frank, I have, without your advice, gone where I intended, and
returned in safety; and as for your country, I will give you a very
handsome present to put me safely out of it, in any direction you
please, to-morrow--the sooner the better.

At this instant Ayto Confu came into his mother's apartment, caught
the last words which I had said, and asked of me, in a very angry
tone of voice, Who is he that wishes you out of the country?--"I do,
sincerely and heartily, said I, for one; but what you last heard was
in consequence of a friendly piece of advice that Abba Salama here has
been giving me."--"Father, father, says Confu, turning to him very
sternly, do you not think the measure of your good deeds is yet near
full? Do you not see this place, Kasmati Eshté's house, surrounded
by the troops of my father Michael, and do you still think yourself
in safety, when you have so lately excommunicated both the King and
Ras? Look you, says he, turning to his mother, what dogs the people
of this country are; that Pagan there, who calls himself a Christian,
did charitably recommend it to Fasil to rob or murder Yagoube, a
stranger offending nobody, when he got him among his Galla in Damot:
this did not succeed. He then persuaded Woodage Asahel to send a
party of robbers from Samseen to intercept him in Maitsha. Coque Abou
Barea himself told me it was at that infidel's desire that he sent
Welleta Selassè of Guesgué with a party to cut him off, who missed him
narrowly at Degwassa; and all this for what? I shall swear they should
not have found ten ounces of gold upon him, except Fasil's present,
and that they dared not touch."--"But God, said Ozoro Esther, saw
the integrity of his heart, and that his hands were clean; and that
is not the case with the men in this country."--"And therefore, said
Confu, he made Fasil his friend and protector. Woodage Asahel's party
fell in with an officer of Welleta Yasous, who cut them all to pieces
while robbing some Agows." Then rising up from the place where he was
sitting at his mother's feet, with a raised voice, and countenance
full of fury, turning to Abba Salama, he said, "And I, too, am now
nobody; a boy! a child! a mockery to three such Pagan infidels as
you, Fasil, and Abou Barea, because Ras Michael is away!"--Says the
Acab Saat, with great composure, or without any seeming anger, "You
are excommunicated, Confu; you are excommunicated if you say I am
Infidel or Pagan: I am a Christian priest."--"A priest of the devil,
says Confu, in a great passion--wine and women, gluttony, lying, and
drunkenness--these are your gods! Away! says he, putting his hand to
his knife: by Saint Michael I swear, ten days shall not pass before
I teach both Coque Abou Barea and you your duty. Come, Yagoube, come
and see my horses; when I have put a good man upon each of them we
shall together hunt your enemies to Sennaar." He swang hastily out of
the door, and I after him, and left Abba Salama dying with fear, as
Ozoro Esther told me afterwards, saying only to her, as he went out,
Remember I did not excommunicate him.

I left Confu with his horses and men; and, though it was now late, I
went to the camp to pay my compliments to Fasil. Having no arms, I was
very much molested both in going and coming, under various pretences;
I was afterwards kept waiting about half an hour in the camp without
seeing him; he only sent me a message that he would see me on the
morrow. However, we met several friends we had seen at Bamba, and from
them we learned at length what we shortly had heard from Ayto Confu,
that Woodage Asahel had sent a party to intercept and rob us; and it
was that party which was called the five Agows, who had passed Fasil's
army the night after we left Kelti[4]. They told us that the Lamb said
they were Agows, not to alarm us, but that he knew very well who they
were, and what was their errand; and that, the night after he left us,
he got upon their track by information from three country men whom
they had robbed of some honey, surrounded them, and, in the morning,
had attacked them west of Geesh, and, though inferior in number, had
slain and wounded the whole party as dexterously as he had promised to
us at our last interview.

I sent a small present to our friend the Lamb, in token of gratitude
to him, and delivered it to three people, that I might be sure one
of them would not steal it, and took Fasil's guarantee to see it
delivered; but this was upon a following day. I resolved to remain
at Koscam in the house the Iteghé had given me, as it was easy to see
things were drawing to a crisis, which would inevitably end in blood.

It was not till the 23d of November I first saw the Iteghé. She sent
for me early in the morning, and had a large breakfast prepared: Ayto
Confu and Ayto Engedan were there; she looked very much worn out and
indisposed. When I came first into her presence, I kneeled, with my
forehead to the ground. She put on a very serious countenance, and,
without desiring me to rise, said gravely to her people about her,
"There, says she, see that madman, who in times like these, when we
the natives of the country are not safe in our own houses, rashly,
against all advice, runs out into the fields to be hunted like a wild
beast by every robber, of which this country is full."

She then made me a sign to rise, which I did, and kissed her hand.
"Madam, said I, if I did this, it was in consequence of the good
lessons your majesty deigned to give me."--"Me! says she, with
surprise, was it I that advised you, at such a time as this, to
put yourself in the way of men like Coque Abou Barea, and Woodage
Asahel, to be ill-used, robbed, and probably murdered?"--"No, said
I, Madam, you certainly never did give me such advice; but you must
own that every day I have heard you say, when you was threatened by
a multitude of powerful enemies, that you was not afraid, you was in
God's hands, and not in theirs. Now, Madam, Providence has hitherto
protected you: I have, in humble imitation of you, had the same
Christian confidence, and I have succeeded. I knew I was in God's
hands, and therefore valued not the bad intentions of all the robbers
in Abyssinia."--"Madam, says Ayto Confu, is not Guesgué yours? does it
pay you any thing?"

"It was mine, says the queen, while any thing was mine; but Michael
took it and gave it to Coque Abou Barea, and since, it has paid me
nothing. Fasil has sent for him about the affair of Yagoube, as he
says, and has ordered him to come in the same manner that he himself
is come in private; but forbid him to bring his army with him,
in order that no means of relief may be possible to this devoted
country." Large tears flowed down her venerable face at saying these
words, and shewed the deep-rooted fear in her heart, that Michael's
coming was decreed without possibility of prevention. "I wonder, says
Ayto Engedan, laughing, to divert her, if Coque Abou Barea is the
same good Christian that you and Yagoube are; if he is not, nothing
else will save him from the hands of Confu and me; for we both want
horses and mules for our men, and he has good ones, and arms too, that
belonged to my father."--"And both of you, says the queen, are as bad
men as either Woodage Asahel or Coque Abou Barea." At this moment the
arrival of Fasil was announced, and we were all turned out, and went
to breakfast. I saw him afterwards going out of the palace. He saluted
me slightly, and seemed much pre-occupied in mind. He only desired me
to come to Gondar next morning, and he would speak to me about Coque
Abou Barea; but this the Iteghé refused to permit me to do, so I
remained at Koscam.

Fasil, although he did not deny that he had made peace with Ras
Michael, yet, to quiet the minds of the people, always solemnly
protested, that, so far from coming to Gondar, he never would consent
to his crossing the Tacazzé; and this had, with most people, the
desired effect; for all Gondar loved Tecla Haimanout as much as they
detested Socinios; but the bloodshed, and cruelty that would certainly
attend Michael's coming, made them wish for any government that would
free them from the terror of that event. On the other hand, Socinios,
though now perfectly persuaded of Fasil's motives, had not deserted
his own cause; he had sent Woodage Asahel, fortified with all his
authority, into Maitsha, in order to raise a commotion there; ordered
it to be proclaimed to the whole body of Galla in that province, that
if they would come to Gondar, and prevent the arrival of Ras Michael,
and bring their Bouco (or sceptre) along with them, they should have
the election of their own governor, and not pay any thing to the king
for seven years to come; and, besides, he had ordered Powussen of
Begemder to endeavour, by a forced march, to surprise Fasil, then at
Gondar, attended by a few troops. Mean time, he dissembled the best
he could; but, as he had very shrewd people to deal with, it was more
than probable his secret was early discovered.

Every hand being now armed, and all measures taken, as far as human
foresight could reach, it was impossible to defer any longer the
coming to blows in some part or other. On the 23d, at night, advice
was received from Adera Tacca Georgis, an officer of Fasil in Maitsha,
that he had attacked Woodage Asahel, who had collected a number of
troops, and was endeavouring to raise commotions; and, after an
obstinate combat, he had defeated him, and slain or wounded most
of his followers: that Asahel himself, wounded twice with a lance,
had, by the goodness of his horse, escaped, and joined Powussen in
Begemder.

These news occasioned Fasil to throw off the mask: he now publicly
avowed it was his intention to restore Tecla Haimanout to the throne,
and that, rather than fail in it, he would replace Ras Michael in all
his posts and dignities. He said that Socinios was created for mockery
only; and publicly asserted, that he was not son of Yasous, but of one
Mercurius, a private man at Degwassa; and indeed he bore not, in his
features or carriage, any resemblance to the royal family from which
he pretended to be descended.

Socinios now saw that he was from henceforward to look upon Fasil
as an enemy. Orders were accordingly given to shut the gates of the
palace, and to station a number of troops in the different courts and
avenues leading to the king's apartment. No person was to be admitted
to the king without examination. The drums were beat, and constant
guard kept; and three hundred Mahometans taken into his service as
musketeers; a measure that gave great offence.

Fasil had taken up his residence in the house which belonged to
the office of Ras, at the other end of the town; and, to shew his
contempt for the king, was very slightly guarded, his army remaining
encamped under the palace. One thing at this time seemed particularly
remarkable; a drum was heard to beat in the house where Fasil was;
whereas it is an invariable rule, that no drum is suffered to beat in
the capital any where but in the house where the king resides. It was
said that king Yasous, second son to the Iteghé, or queen-mother, and
father to Joas, had left two sons by a slave of the queen; indeed he
had so many by low people, that very little care was taken of them,
not even that of sending them to the mountain Wechné. One of these,
after the murder of Joas, had appeared in Gojam, resolved to try his
fortune; but he was apprehended by the governor of that province, sent
to Gondar, and then to Wechnè. It was said the other was with Fasil,
in Gondar; that the drum that then beat in Fasil's house announced
his speedy intention of making him king: all was confusion within the
palace, but the Ras kept up a strict police in the town.

It was then towards the end of November, when, by mediation of the
Abuna, the Queen, and the Itcheguè, peace was unexpectedly made
between Socinios and Fasil; the latter swearing allegiance to Socinios
as to his only sovereign, and the Abuna pronouncing excommunication
upon either of them which should become the enemy of the other. What
was the intention of this farce I never yet could learn; for the very
next day Fasil deprived Gusho and Powussen of their governments of
Amhara and Begemder, which was an express proof that his intention
still was to restore Tecla Haimanout. The doors of the king's palace
were again immediately shut, and signs of hostilities commenced as
before.

I was dining with Ozoro Esther, when a messenger arrived from Coque
Abou Barea, with a complaint to the queen that he was on his march to
Gondar, to pay his allegiance to Socinios, and bring him the tribute
of his province, when he received a message from Fasil to return the
greatest part of his troops; but that, desiring to be as useful as
possible in preventing the coming of Michael, he so far disobeyed that
order as to bring with him a considerable body of the best of his
soldiers, sending the rest home under the conduct of Welleta Selassé;
but that on the 26th, early in the morning, he had been surprised
by Confu and Engedan, who, without any cause alledged, had killed
and dispersed all his troops, and taken from them all the horses
and mules they could lay their hands on: that they after followed
Welleta Selassé, and had come up with him unawares, just as he entered
Guesgué, had defeated him, and that Ayto Engedan, in the beginning of
the fight, had slain him with his own hand, by wounding him in the
throat with a lance when stretching out his hand to parley; after
which, they had set fire to nine villages in Guesgué, and given the
plunder to their soldiers.

In the mean time Powussen had not disregarded the request of Socinios.
He had attempted to surprise Fasil, but could not pass Aylo, who was
at Emfras, without falling upon him first, which he did, dispersing
his troops with little resistance. Upon the first intelligence of
this, Fasil proclaimed Tecla Haimanout king; and, striking his tents,
sat down at Abba Samuel, a collection of villages about two miles
from Gondar, inviting all people, that would escape the vengeance of
Ras Michael, to come and join him, and leave Gondar. From this he
retreated near to Dingleber, on the side of the lake, and intercepted
all provisions coming to Gondar, which occasioned a very great famine,
and many poor people died.

Hitherto I had no intercourse with Socinios, never having been in his
presence, but when the Galla, the murderer of Joas, was tried; nor had
I any reason to think he knew me, or cared for me more than any Greek
that was in Gondar; but I had a good friend at court, who waked when I
slept, and did not suffer me to pass unknown; this was the Acab Saat,
Salama, who had instigated the king, on the 5th of December, in one of
his drunken fits, to set out from the palace in the night, attended
by a number of banditti, mostly Mahometans, to plunder several
houses; he slew one man, as it was said, with his own hand: among
these devoted houses mine happened to be one, but I was then happily
at Koscam. The next was Metical Aga's, one of whose servants escaped
into a church-yard, the other being slain. The leader of this unworthy
mob was Confu, brother to Guebra Mehedin. Every thing that could
be carried away was stolen or broken; among which was a reflecting
telescope, a barometer, and thermometer; a great many papers and
sketches of drawings, first torn, then burnt by Confu's own hand, with
many curses and threats against me.

The next day, about nine o'clock, I had a message to come to the
palace, where I went, and was immediately admitted. Socinios was
sitting, his eyes half closed, red as scarlet with last night's
debauch; he was apparently at that moment much in liquor; his mouth
full of tobacco, squirting his spittle out of his mouth to a very
great distance; with this he had so covered the floor, that it was
with very great difficulty I could chuse a clean place to kneel
and make my obeisance. He was dressed like the late king, but, in
every thing else, how unlike! my mind was filled with horror and
detestation, to see the throne on which he sat so unworthily occupied.
I regarded him as I advanced with the most perfect contempt: Hamlet's
lines described him exactly:--

    A murtherer and a villain:
    A slave, that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your preceding lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire, and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket;
    A king of shreds and patches.

    SHAKESPEARE.

It requires something of innate royalty to personate a king.

When I got up and stood before him, he seemed to be rather
disconcerted, and not prepared to say any thing to me. There were
few people there besides servants, most men of consideration having
left Gondar, and gone with Fasil. After two or three squirts through
his teeth, and a whisper from his brother Chremation, whom I had
never before seen--"Wherefore is it, says he, that you who are a
_great man_, do not attend the palace? you were constantly with Tecla
Haimanout, the exile, or usurper, in peace and war: you used to
ride with him, and divert him with your tricks on horseback, and, I
believe, ate and drank with him. Where is all that money you got from
Ras el Feel, of which province, I am told, you are still governor,
though you conceal it? How dare you keep Yasine in that government,
and not allow Abd el Jelleel, who is my slave, appointed to enter and
govern that province?" I waited patiently till he had said all he
had to say, and made a slight inclination of the head. I answered,
"I am no great man, even in my own country; one proof of this is my
being here in yours. I arrived in the time of the late king, and I
was recommended to him by his friends in Arabia. You are perfectly
well-informed as to the great kindness he did all along shew me, but
this was entirely from his goodness, and no merit of mine. I never
did eat or drink with him; it was an honour I could not have been
capable of aspiring to. Custom has established the contrary; and
for me, I saw no pleasure or temptation to transgress this custom,
though it had been in my option, as it was not. I have, for the most
part, seen him eat and drink; an honour I enjoyed in common with his
confidential servants, as being an officer of his household. The gold
you mention, which I have several times got from the late King and Ras
el Feel, I constantly spent for his service, and for my own honour.
But at present I am neither governor of Ras el Feel, nor have I any
post under heaven, nor do I desire it. Yasine, I suppose, holds his
from Ayto Confu his superior, who holds it from the king by order of
Ras Michael, but of this I know nothing. As for tricks on horseback,
I know not what you mean. I have for many years been in constant
practice of horsemanship among the Arabs. Mine, too, is a country of
horsemen; and I profess to have attained to a degree not common, the
management both of the lance and of fire-arms; but I am no buffoon,
to shew tricks. The profession of arms is my birth-right derived from
my ancestors, and with these, at his desire, I have often diverted the
king, as an amusement worthy of him, and by no means below me."--"The
king! says he in a violent passion, and who then am I? a slave! Do you
know, with a stamp of my foot I can order you to be hewn to pieces in
an instant. You are a Frank, a dog, a liar, and a slave! Why did you
tell the Iteghé that your house was robbed of 50 ounces of gold? Any
other king but myself would order your eyes to be pulled out in a
moment, and your carcase to be thrown to the dogs."

What he said was true; bad kings have most executioners. I was not,
however, dismayed; I was in my own mind, stranger and alone, superior
to such a beast upon a throne. "The Iteghé, said I, is at present
at Koscam, and will inform you if I told her of any gold that was
stolen from me, except a gold-mounted knife which the late king gave
me at Dingleber the day after the battle of Limjour, and which was
accidentally left in my house, as I had not worn it since he went to
Tigrè." He squirted at this moment an arch of tobacco-spittle towards
me, whether on purpose or not I do not know. I felt myself very much
moved; it narrowly missed me. At this instant an old man, of a noble
appearance, who sat in a corner of the room next him, got up, and,
in a firm tone of voice, said, "I can bear this no longer; we shall
become a proverb, and the hatred of all mankind. What have you to do
with Yagoube, or why did you send for him? he was favoured by the late
king, but not more than I have seen Greeks or Armenians in all the
late reigns; and yet these very people confess, in their own country,
they are not worthy of being his servants. He is a friend, not only
to the king, but to us all: the whole people love him. As for myself,
I never spoke to him twice before; when he might have gone to Tigrè
with Michael his friend, he staid at Gondar with us: so you, of all
others, have least reason to complain of him, since he has preferred
you to the Ras, tho' you have given him nothing. As for riding, I
wish Yagoube had just rode with you as much as with Tecla Haimanout,
and you spent as much time with him as your predecessor did; last
night's disgrace would not then have fallen upon us, at least would
have been confined to the limits of your own kingdom; you would have
neither disobliged Fasil nor the Iteghé; and, when the day of trial is
at hand, you would have been better able to answer it, than, by going
on at this rate, there is any appearance you will be." This person,
I understood afterwards, was Ras Sanuda, nephew to the Iteghé, and
son of Ras Welled de l'Oul; he had been banished to Kuara in the late
king's time, so I had no opportunity of knowing him.

All the time of this harangue Socinios's eyes were mostly shut, and
his mouth open, and slavering tobacco; he was rolling from side to
side scarcely preserving his equilibrium. When Sanuda stopt, he began
with an air of drollery, "You are very angry to-day, Baba." And
turning to me, said, "Tomorrow, see you bring me that horse which
Yasine sent you to Koscam; and bring me Yasine himself, or you will
hear of it; slave and Frank as you are, enemy to Mary the virgin,
bring me the horse!" Sanuda took me by the hand, saying in a whisper,
"Don't fear him, I am here; but go home; next time you come here you
will have horses enough along with you." He, too, seemed in liquor;
and, making me a sign to withdraw, I left the king and his minister
together with great willingness, and returned to Koscam to the Iteghé,
to whom I told what had passed, and who ordered me to stay near Ozoro
Esther, as in her service, and go no more to the palace.

At this time certain intelligence was received that Ras Michael was
arrived in Lasta with Guigarr, Shum, or chief of the clan called Waag,
once a mortal enemy to Michael, though now at peace with him, and
serving him as his conductor. Through his country is the only passage
from Tigrè to Begemder and Belessen, and many armies have perished by
endeavouring to force it. Michael and the king now passed under the
protection of Guigarr, notwithstanding Powussen had many parties among
the other clans that wished to prevent him. On the 15th of December he
forded the Tacazzè, and turned a little to the left, as if he intended
to pass through the middle of Begemder, though he had really no such
design, but only to bring Powussen to an engagement. Seeing this was
not likely, and only tended to waste time, he pursued his journey
straight towards Gondar, not in his usual way, burning and destroying,
but quietly, correcting abuses, and regulating the police of the
country through which he passed, for he was yet in fear.

The news of his having passed the Tacazzé determined Socinios and
the Iteghé to fly; and they set out accordingly. Socinios directed
his flight, first towards Begemder, but, the next day, turned to
the right, through Dembea, and joined the queen at Azazo, where
great altercations and disputes followed between them. The queen had
engaged the Abuna to attend her, and that prelate had consented, upon
receiving fifteen mules and thirty ounces of gold, which were paid
accordingly: But when the queen sent, the morning of her departure, to
put the Abuna in mind of his promise, his servants stoned the Iteghé's
messenger, without suffering him to approach the house, but they kept
the mules and the gold. The queen continued her flight to Degwassa,
near the lake Tzana, and sent all that was valuable that she had
brought with her, into the island of Dek.

Ayto Engedan and Confu were at hand at the head of large parties
scouring the country, at once protecting the Iteghé, and securing
as many of those of Socinios's people as were thought worthy of
punishment. Sanuda, too, was in arms; and, throwing off the mask,
was now acting under the immediate direction of Ras Michael, and
had apprehended many of those noblemen of Tigrè who had revolted
against the Ras, particularly Guebra Denghel, married to Ras
Michael's granddaughter, descended from one of the noblest houses in
the province, and a man particularly distinguished for generosity,
openness, and affability of manners; and Sebaat Laab and Kefla Mariam,
men of great consideration in Michael's province. Confu and Sanuda
having joined, entered Gondar, and took possession of the king's
house, and put a stop to these excesses and robberies which had become
very frequent since the Iteghé's flight.

One day, while I was sitting at Koscam, Yasine entered the court
before the house, and, coming into the room, fell down and kissed the
ground before me, after the manner they salute their superior. He
told me he came from Ayto Confu, who ordered him to do homage to me
as usual for the province of Ras el Feel, and that I was to come to
him directly, and go out to meet the king, for several of his people
were already arrived at Gondar. I sent him back to Ayto Confu with my
respectful thanks, declined accepting of any office till I should see
the king; and, as he himself had named the place to be Mariam Ohha, I
thought it was my duty to stay till he came there.

In the mean time the unfortunate Socinios continued his flight, in
company with the queen, till they came to the borders of Kuara, her
native country. Those who made Socinios a king had never made him a
friend. It was here suggested, that his presence would infallibly
occasion a pursuit which might endanger the queen, her country, and
all her friends. Upon this it was resolved to abandon the unworthy
Socinios to the soldiers, who stript him naked, giving him only a rag
to cover him, and a good horse, and with these they dismissed him to
seek his fortune.

After a short stay in Kuara, the queen turned to the left towards
Burè. All Maitsha assembled to escort her to Fasil, while he led her
through Damot to the frontiers of Gojam, where she was received in
triumph by her daughter Ozoro Welleta Israel, and Ayto her grandson,
to whom half of that province belonged, and with them she rested at
last in safety, after a long and anxious journey.

On the 21st of December a message came to me from Ozoro Esther,
desiring I would attend her son Confu to meet the king, as his
Fit-Auraris had marked out the camp at Mariam-Ohha; observing, that I
had a very indifferent knife or dagger in my girdle, (that which I had
received from the king being stolen, when my house was plundered) with
her own hands she made me a present of a magnificent one, mounted with
gold which she had chosen with that intention, and laid upon the seat
beside her. She told me she had already sent to acquaint her husband,
Ras Michael, how much she had been obliged to me in his absence, both
for my attention to her and her eldest son, who had been several times
sick since his departure, and that I might expect to receive a kind
reception.

   there--Universal Terror on the Approach of the Army--Several
   great Men of the Rebels apprehended and executed--Great Hardness
   of the King's Heart._


Having still some doubt about the propriety of going to Mariam-Ohha,
till the king had taken post there, I appointed with Ayto Confu to
meet him next morning, the 22d, in the plain below the church of
Abbo, where is the pass called Semma Confu, the dangerous path, from
its being always a place where banditti resort to rob passengers in
unsettled times.

In my way through the town, though the day had scarce dawned, numbers
of the king's servants, that had come from Tigrè, flocked about me
with great demonstrations of joy; and, by the time I got into the
plain below Abbo, I had already collected a strong party both of
horse and foot. This was not my intention; I had set out unarmed,
attended only by two Abyssinian servants on horseback, but without
lance or shield, and in this manner I intended to present myself to
the king as one of the suite of Ayto Confu: but all my endeavours were
in vain; and I saw that, making the best of my way, and profiting
of the early time of the morning, was the only method left to avoid
increasing my retinue. I must own the good disposition of these people
to me, and the degree of favour they reported me to be in, and, above
all, Ozoro Esther's assurances had given me great comfort; for several
people of no authority, indeed, had prophesied that Ras Michael would
be much offended at my having thrown a carpet over the body of Joas,
and at my not having gone to Tigrè with him.

I passed the three heaps of stones under which lie the three monks
who were stoned to death in the time of David IV.; and at the bottom
of the hill whereon stands the church of Abbo, I was met by Yasine,
and about 20 horsemen, having on their coats of mail, their helmets
upon their heads, and their viziers down; their pikes perpendicular,
with their points in the air, so that by one motion more, placing them
horizontally in their rests, they were prepared to charge at a word.
I asked Yasine what was the meaning of his being in that equipage in
such hot weather, when there was no enemy? He replied, It was given
him in orders from Ayto Confu last night; and that, with regard to
an enemy, there was one that had seized the pass of Semma Confu, and
obstinately refused to let us through, unless we forced them. Sure,
said I, Ayto Confu knows, that heavy armed-men on horseback are not
fit to force passes through craggy mountains, where they may be all
killed by rolling stones upon them, without their even seeing their
enemy. Strange, strange, said I, (speaking to myself) that any party
should be so audacious as to take post in the king's front, at six
miles distance, and put themselves between him and the capital: I am
sure they heartily deserve to be cut in pieces, and so they certainly
will. Where is Ayto Confu? It was answered by Yasine, That he was gone
forward to the mouth of the pass to reconnoitre it, and would meet us
there. We marched on accordingly, across the plain, about half a mile;
but I was surprised to see all my attendants, that I had picked up by
the way, laughing, excepting Yasine's men, and that none of the rest
made horse, mule, or gun ready as if they were in danger; so that I
began now strongly to suspect some trick on the part of Confu, as he
was much given to jest and sport, being a very young man.

A little before we came to the mouth of the pass, a soldier came
to us and asked who we were? and was answered, it was Yasine, Ayto
Confu's servant at Ras el Feel. To which it was replied, he knew no
such person. He was scarcely gone when another arrived with the same
question. I began to be impatient, as the sun was then growing very
hot; and answered, It was Yagoube, the white man, the king's friend
and servant. I was again answered, No such person could pass there.
The third time, being interrogated by one whom I knew to be Ayto
Confu's servant, Yasine answered, it is Yagoube, the king's governor
of Ras el Feel, with the slave Yasine, the moor, come to do the king
homage, and to die for him, if he commands, in the midst of his
enemies. We were answered, He is welcome: upon which the servant,
going back, brought a drum, and beat it upon the rock, crying, as in
a proclamation, "Yagoube is Governor of Ras el Feel, Commander of
the king's black horse, Lord of Geesh, and Gentleman of the king's
bed-chamber." Here this farce, the contrivance of Ayto Confu, ended.
With him were many more of the king's servants, my old acquaintances,
and we all sat down by a spring-well, under the shade of the rock, to
a hearty breakfast prepared for us by Ozoro Esther.

After this was finished with a great deal of chearfulness, and being
ready to get on horseback, we saw a man running towards us in great
speed, who, upon his arrival, asked us where the king was, and if
we were his Fit-Auraris? To this we made him no answer; but, laying
hold of him, obliged him to declare his errand. He said that he was
a servant of Negadé Ras Mahomet, of Dara, who had apprehended Ayto
Confu, brother of Guebra Mehedin, of whom I have spoken at large,
(never for any good) and that he had brought him along with him.
This miscreant, whom we had found out to be the principal actor and
persuader of the robbery of my house, while in a drunken frolic with
the wretched Socinios, was now in his way before the king, where,
if all his delinquency had been known, he would infallibly have
lost his eyes, his life, or both. He was nephew to the Iteghé, as
has been already mentioned, son to her brother Basha Eusebius, and
consequently cousin-german to Ayto Confu himself, who, with great
diffidence, asked me if I could pardon his cousin, and allow him to
be delivered out of Mahomet's hands, which, ill as he deserved of me,
I very readily complied with; for I would not for the world have had
it thought that I was the occasion of his death, after it had been so
often said, though falsely, that I had been the cause of that of his
brother. Mahomet delivered him to Confu and me, without hesitation,
and promised not to complain to Ras Michael; but he threatened, if
ever again he fell into his hands, that he would certainly put him to
death, which he well saw would not be very disagreeable to any of his
relations, provided it happened in the field, or any other way than by
the hands of a public executioner. Ayto Confu, however, insisted upon
bringing him out, and correcting him publicly, though he was by ten
years the younger of the two; and the wretch was accordingly severely
whipt with wands, and delivered after to a servant of Ozoro Esther's
to conduct him to some safe place, where he might be out of the reach
of Ras Michael, at least for a time.

We now got on horseback, and having ordered Yasine and his soldiers to
disarm, we all went in the habit of peace, with joyful hearts, to meet
the king, who was already arrived at Mariam-Ohha, and was encamped
there since about eleven o'clock that forenoon.

My first business was to wait on Ras Michael, who, tho' very busy,
admitted me immediately upon being announced. This was a compliment
I was under no necessity of paying him, as the king's servant; but I
was resolved to take nothing upon me, but appear in all the humility
of a private stranger. This he quickly perceived, so that, when he saw
me approaching near him to kiss the ground, he made an effort as if
to rise, which he never did, being lame, nor could do without help;
stretching out his hand as if to prevent me, repeated the words in a
hurry, _be gzeir, be gzeir_, or, for God's sake don't, for God's sake
don't. However, the compliment was paid. As soon as I arose, without
desiring me to sit down, he asked aloud, Have you seen the king? I
said, Not yet. Have you any complaint to make against any one, or
grace to ask? I answered, None, but the continuance of your favour. He
answered, That I am sure I owe you; go to the king. I took my leave. I
had been jostled and almost squeezed to death attempting to enter, but
large room was made me for retiring.

The reception I had met with was the infallible rule according to
which the courtiers were to speak to me from that time forward. Man
is the same creature everywhere, although different in colour: the
court of London and that of Abyssinia are, in their principles, one. I
then went immediately to the king in the presence-chamber. His largest
tent was crowded to a degree of suffocation; I resolved, therefore, to
wait till this throng was over, and was going to my own tent, which
my servants pitched near that of Kefla Yasous, by that general's own
desire, but before I could reach it I was called by a servant from the
king. Though the throng had greatly decreased, there was still a very
crowded circle.

The king was sitting upon an ivory stool, such as are represented
upon ancient medals; he had got this as a present from Arabia since
he went to Tigrè; he was plainly, but very neatly dressed, and his
hair combed and perfumed. When I kissed the ground before him, "There,
says he, is an arch rebel, what punishment shall we inflict upon him?"
"Your majesty's justice, said I, will not suffer you to inflict any
punishment upon me that can possibly equal the pleasure I feel this
day at seeing you sitting there." He smiled with great good nature,
giving me first the back, and then the palm of his hand to kiss. He
then made me a sign to stand in my place, which I immediately did for
a moment; and, seeing he was then upon business, which I knew nothing
of, I took leave of him, and could not help reflecting, as I went,
that, of all the vast multitude then in my sight, I was, perhaps, the
only one destitute either of hope or fear.

All Gondar, and the neighbouring towns and villages, had poured out
their inhabitants to meet the king upon his return. The fear of Ras
Michael was the cause of all this; and every one trembled, lest, by
being absent, he should be thought a favourer of Socinios.

The side of the hill, which slopes gently from Belessen, is here
very beautiful; it is covered thick with herbage down to near the
foot, where it ends in broken rocks. The face of this hill is of
great extent, exposed to the W. and S. W.; a small, but clear-running
stream, rising in Belessen, runs through the middle of it, and falls
into the Mogetch. It is not considerable, being but a brook, called
Mariam-Ohha, (_i. e._ the water of Mariam) from a church dedicated
to the Virgin, near where it rises in Belessen; an infinite number
of people spread themselves all over the hill, covered with cotton
garments as white as snow. The number could not be less than 50 or
60,000 men and women, all strewed upon the grass promiscuously. Most
of these had brought their victuals with them, others trusted to
their friends and acquaintances in the army; the soldiers had plenty
of meat; as soon as the king had crossed the Tacazzé all was lawful
prize; and though they did not murder or burn, as was Michael's custom
in his former marches, yet they drove away all the cattle they could
seize, either in Begemder or Belessen. Besides this, a great quantity
of provisions of every sort poured in from the neighbourhood of
Gondar, in presents to the king and great men, though there was really
famine in that capital, by the roads being every way obstructed; there
was plenty, however, in the camp.

It was then the month of December, the fairest time of the year, when
the sun was in the southern tropic, and no danger from rain in the
day, nor in the night from dew; so that, if the remembrance of the
past had not hung heavy on some hearts, it was a party of pleasure,
of the most agreeable kind, to convoy the king to his capital. The
priests from all the convents for many miles round, in dresses of
yellow and white cotton, came, with their crosses and drums, in
procession, and greatly added to the variety of the scene. Among
these were 300 of the monks of Koscam, with their large crosses, and
kettle-drums of silver, the gift of the Iteghé in the days of her
splendour; at present it was very doubtful what their future fate was
to be, after their patroness had fled from Koscam. But what most drew
the attention of all ranks of people, was the appearance of the Abuna
and Itchegué, whose character, rank, and dignity exempted them from
leaving Gondar to meet the king himself; but they were then in great
fear, and in the form of criminals, and were treated with very little
respect or ceremony by the soldiers, who considered them as enemies.

It will be remembered, upon a report being spread just after the
election of Socinios, that Ras Michael's affairs were taking an
adverse turn while besieging the mountain Haramat; that the Abuna,
Itchegué, and Acab Saat, had solemnly excommunicated the king, Ras
Michael, and all their adherents, declaring them accursed, and
absolving all people from their allegiance to Tecla Haimanout. But as
soon as the king began his march from Tigrè, application for pardon
was made through every channel possible, and it was not without great
difficulty that Ras Michael could be brought to pardon them, chiefly
by the entreaty of Ozoro Esther. But this mortification was prescribed
to them as a condition of forgiveness, that they should meet the king
at Mariam-Ohha, not with drums and crosses, or a retinue, but in the
habit and appearance of supplicants. Accordingly they both came by the
time the king had alighted, but they brought no tent with them, nor
was any pitched for them, nor any honour shewn them.

The Abuna had with him a priest, or monk, on a mule, and two
beggarly-looking servants on foot; the Itchegué two monks, that looked
like servants, distinguished by a cowl only on their heads; they were
both kept waiting till past three o'clock, and then were admitted, and
sharply rebuked by the Ras: they after went to the king, who presently
dismissed them without saying a word to either, or without allowing
them to be seated in his presence, which both of them, by their rank,
were entitled to be. I asked the Abuna to make use of my tent to avoid
the sun: this he willingly accepted of, was crest-fallen a little,
spoke very lowly and familiarly; said he had always a regard for me,
which I had no reason to believe; desired me to speak favourable of
him before the King and the Ras, which I promised faithfully to do. I
ordered coffee, which he drank with great pleasure, during which he
gave me several hints, as if he thought his pardon was not compleated;
and at last asked me directly what were my sentiments, and what I had
heard? I said, I believed every thing was favourable as to him and the
Itchegué, but I did not know how much farther the king's forgiveness
would extend. I know, says he, what you mean; that Abba Salama, (curse
upon him) he is the author of it all: What do I know of these black
people, who am a stranger, so lately come into the country? and,
indeed, he seemed to know very little; for, besides his native Arabic,
which he spoke like a peasant, he had not learned one word of any of
the various languages used in the country in which he was to live and
die. Having finished coffee, I left him speaking to some of his own
people; about half an hour afterwards, he went away.

Ras Michael had brought with him from Tigrè about 20,000 men, the
best soldiers of the empire; about 6000 of these were musqueteers,
about 12,000 armed with lances and shields, and about 6000 men had
joined them from Gondar; a large proportion of these were horsemen,
who were scouring the country in all directions, bringing with them
such unhappy people as deserved to be, and were therefore destined for
public example.

The short way from Tigrè to Gondar was by Lamalmon, (that is the
mountain of Samen) and by Woggora. Ayto Tesfos had maintained
himself in the government of Samen since Joas's time, by whom he was
appointed; he had continued constantly in enmity with Ras Michael,
and had now taken possession of the passes near the Tacazzé, so as to
cut off all communication between Gondar and Tigrè. On the side of
Belessen, between Lasta and Begemder, was Ras Michael and his army.
Powussen and the Begemder troops cut off the road to Gojam by Foggora
and Dara. Ayto Engedan, who was to be considered as an advanced post
of Fasil, was at Tshemmera, in the way of the Agow and Maitsha, and
Coque Abou Barea on the N. W. side, towards Kuara; so that Gondar was
so completely invested, that several of the people died with hunger.

Ras Michael had ordered his own nephew, Tecla and Welleta Michael,
the king's master of the household, to endeavour to force their way
from Tigrè to Woggora, and open that communication, if possible, with
Gondar; and for that purpose had left him 4000 men in the province of
Siré, on the other side of the Tacazzé; and now scarce was his tent
pitched at Mariam-Ohha, when he detached Kefla Yasous with 6000 men to
force a junction with Michael and Tecla from the Woggora side. Their
orders were, if possible, to draw Tesfos to an engagement, but not to
venture to storm him in the mountain; for Tesfos's principal post, the
Jews Rock, was inaccessible, where he had plowed and sowed plentifully
for his subsistence, and had a quantity of the purest running-water
at all seasons of the year: to irritate Tesfos more, Kefla Yasous
was then named governor of Samen in his place. This brave and active
officer had set out immediately for his command, and it was to me the
greatest disappointment possible, that I did not see him.

Although Ras Michael had been in council all night, the signal was
made to strike the tents at the first dawn of day, and soon after,
the whole army was in motion; the council had been in the Ras's tent,
not in presence of the king, with whom I had staid the most part of
the evening, indeed, till late in the night; he seemed to have lost
all his former gaiety, and to be greatly troubled in mind; inquired
much about the Iteghé, and Fasil; told me he had sent his assurance
of peace to the Iteghé, and desired her not to leave Koscam: but she
had returned for answer, that she could not trust Michael, after the
threatenings he had sent against her from Tigrè. It was observed also,
in this day's march, that, contrary to his custom before crossing
the Tacazzé, he received all that came out to meet him with a sullen
countenance, and scarce ever answered or spake to them. Michael also,
every day since the same date, had put on a behaviour more and more
severe and brutal. He had enough of this at all times.

It was the 23d of December when we encamped on the Mogetch, just below
Gondar. This behaviour was so conspicuous to the whole people, that no
sooner were the tents pitched, (it being about eleven o'clock) than
they all stole home to Gondar in small parties without their dinner,
and presently a report was spread that the king and Ras Michael came
determined to burn the town, and put the inhabitants all to the sword.
This occasioned the utmost consternation, and caused many to fly to
Fasil.

As for me, the king's behaviour shewed me plainly all was not right,
and an accident in the way confirmed it. He had desired me to ride
before him, and shew him the horse I had got from Fasil, which was
then in great beauty and order, and which I had kept purposely for
him. It happened that, crossing the deep bed of a brook, a plant of
the kantuffa hung across it. I had upon my shoulders a white goat
skin, of which it did not take hold; but the king, who was dressed
in the habit of peace, his long hair floating all around his face,
wrapt up in his mantle, or thin cotton cloak, so that nothing but his
eyes could be seen, was paying more attention to the horse than to
the branch of kantuffa beside him; it took first hold of his hair,
and the fold of the cloak that covered his head, then spread itself
over his whole shoulder in such a manner, that, notwithstanding all
the help that could be given him, and that I had, at first seeing it,
cut the principal bough asunder with my knife, no remedy remained but
he must throw off the upper garment, and appear in the under one, or
waistcoat, with his head and face bare before all the spectators.

This is accounted great disgrace to a king, who always appears covered
in public. However, he did not seem to be ruffled, nor was there any
thing particular in his countenance more than before, but with great
composure, and in rather a low voice, he called twice, Who is the Shum
of this district? Unhappily he was not far off. A thin old man of
sixty, and his son about thirty, came trotting, as their custom is,
naked to their girdle, and stood before the king, who was, by this
time, quite cloathed again. What had struck the old man's fancy, I
know not, but he passed my horse laughing, and seemingly wonderfully
content with himself. I could not help considering him as a type of
mankind in general, never more confident and careless than when on the
brink of destruction; the king asked if he was Shum of that place? he
answered in the affirmative, and added, which was not asked of him,
that the other was his son.

There is always near the king, when he marches, an officer called
Kanitz Kitzera, the executioner of the camp; he has upon the tore of
his saddle a quantity of thongs made of bull hide, rolled up very
artificially, this is called the _tarade_. The king made a sign with
his head, and another with his hand, without speaking, and two loops
of the tarade were instantly thrown round the Shum and his son's neck,
and they were both hoisted upon the same tree, the tarade cut, and the
end made fast to a branch. They were both left hanging, but I thought
so aukwardly, that they should not die for some minutes, and might
surely have been saved had any one dared to cut them down; but fear
had fallen upon every person who had not attended the king to Tigrè.

This cruel beginning seemed to me an omen that violent resolutions
had been taken, the execution of which was immediately to follow;
for though the king had certainly a delight in the shedding of human
blood in the field, yet till that time I never saw him order an
execution by the hands of the hangman; on the contrary, I have often
seen him shudder and express disgust, lowly and in half words, at
such executions ordered every day by Ras Michael. In this instance he
seemed to have lost that feeling; and rode on, sometimes conversing
about Fasil's horse, or other indifferent subjects, to those who were
around him, without once reflecting upon the horrid execution he had
then so recently occasioned.

In the evening of the 23d, when encamped upon the Mogetch, came
Sanuda, the person who had made Socinios king, and who had been Ras
under him; he was received with great marks of favour, in reward of
the treacherous part he had acted. He brought with him prisoners,
Guebra Denghel, the Ras's son-in-law, one of the best and most amiable
men in Abyssinia, but who had unfortunately embraced the wrong side
of the question; and with him Sebaat Laab and Kefla Mariam, both men
of great families in Tigrè. These were, one after the other, thrown
violently on their faces before the king. I was exceedingly distressed
for Guebra Denghel; he prayed the king with the greatest earnestness
to order him to be put to death before the door of his tent, and not
delivered to his cruel father-in-law. To this the king made no answer,
nor did he shew any signs of pity, but waved his hand, as a sign to
carry them to Ras Michael, where they were put in custody and loaded
with irons.

About two hours later came Ayto Aylo, son of Kasmati Eshtè, whom
the king had named governor of Begemder; he brought with him
Chremation brother to Socinios, and Abba Salama the Acab Saat, who
had excommunicated his father, and been instrumental in his murder by
Fasil. I had a great curiosity to see how they would treat the Acab
Saat, for my head was full of what I had read in the European books of
exemption that churchmen had in this country from the jurisdiction of
the civil power.

Aylo had made his legs to be tied under the mule's belly, his hands
behind his back, and a rope made fast to them, which a man held in his
hand on one side, while another led the halter of the mule on the
other, both of them with lances in their hands. Chremation had his
hands bound, but his legs were not tied, nor was there any rope made
fast to his hands by which he was held. While they were untying Abba
Salama, I went into the presence-chamber, and stood behind the king's
chair. Very soon after Aylo's men brought in their prisoners, and, as
is usual, threw them down violently with their faces to the ground;
their hands being bound behind them, they had a very rude fall upon
their faces.

The Acab Saat rose in a violent passion, he struggled to get loose
his hands, that he might be free to use the act of denouncing
excommunication, which is by lifting the right hand, and extending the
forefinger; finding that impossible, he cried out, Unloose my hands,
or you are all excommunicated. It was with difficulty he could be
prevailed upon to hear the king, who with great composure, or rather
indifference, said to him, You are the first ecclesiastical officer
in my household, you are the third in the whole kingdom; but I have
not yet learned you ever had power to curse your sovereign, or exhort
his subjects to murder him. You are to be tried for this crime by
the judges to-morrow, so prepare to shew in your defence, upon what
precepts of Christ, or his apostles, or upon what part of the general
councils, you found your title to do this.

Let my hands be unloosed, cries Salama violently; I am a priest, a
servant of God; and they have power, says David, to put kings in
chains, and nobles in irons. And did not Samuel hew king Agag to
pieces before the Lord? I excommunicate you, Tecla Haimanout. And he
was going on, when Tecla Mariam, son of the king's secretary, a young
man, struck the Acab Saat so violently on the face, that it made his
mouth gush out with blood, saying, at same time, What! suffer this in
the king's presence? Upon which both Chremation and the Acab Saat were
hurried out of the tent without being suffered to say more; indeed the
blow seemed to have so much disconcerted Abba Salama, that it deprived
him for a time of the power of speaking.

In Abyssinia it is death to strike, or lift the hand to strike,
before the king; but in this case the provocation was so great, so
sudden, and unexpected, and the youth's worth and the insolence of the
offender so apparent to every body, that a slight reproof was ordered
to be given to Tecla Mariam (by his father only) but he lost no favour
for what he had done, either with the King, Michael, or the people.

When the two prisoners were carried before the Ras, he refused to see
them, but loaded them with irons, and committed them to close custody.
That night a council was held in the king's tent, but it broke early
up; afterwards another before the Ras, which sat much later; the
reason was, that the first, where the king was, only arranged the
business of to-morrow, while that before the Ras considered all that
was to be done or likely to happen at any time.

On the 24th the drum beat, and the army was on their march by dawn of
day: they halted a little after passing the rough ground, and then
doubled their ranks, and formed into close order of battle, the king
leading the center; a few of his black horses were in two lines
immediately before him, their spears pointed upwards, his officers
and nobility on each side, and behind him the rest of the horse,
distributed in the wings, excepting prince George and Ayto Confu, who,
with two small bodies, not exceeding a hundred, scoured the country,
sometimes in the front, and sometimes in the flank. I do not remember
who commanded the rest of the army, my mind was otherwise engaged;
they marched close and in great order, and every one trembled for
the fate of Gondar. We passed the Mahometan town, and encamped upon
the river Kahha, in front of the market-place. As soon as we had
turned our faces to the town, our kettle-drums were brought to the
front, and, after beating some time, two proclamations were made.
The first was, That all those who had flour or barley in quantities,
should bring it that very day to a fair market, on pain of having
their houses plundered; and that all people, soldiers, or others, who
attempted by force to take any provisions without having first paid
for them in ready money, should be hanged upon the spot. A bench was
quickly brought, and set under a tree in the middle of the market; a
judge appointed to sit there; a strong guard, and several officers
placed round him; behind him an executioner, and a large coil of
ropes laid at his feet. The second proclamation was, That everybody
should remain at home in their houses, otherwise the person flying, or
deserting the town, should be reputed a rebel, his goods confiscated,
his house burnt, and his family chastised at the king's pleasure for
seven years; so far was well and politic.

There was at Gondar a sort of mummers, being a mixture of buffoons
and ballad-singers, and posture-masters. These people, upon all
public occasions, run about the streets, and on private ones, such
as marriages, come to the court-yards before the houses, where they
dance, and sing songs of their own composing in honour of the day,
and perform all sorts of antics: many a time, on his return from the
field with victory, they had met Ras Michael, and received his bounty
for singing his praises, and welcoming him upon his return home. The
day the Abuna excommunicated the king, this set of vagrants made part
of the solemnity; they abused, ridiculed, and traduced Michael in
lampoons and scurrilous rhymes, calling him crooked, lame, old, and
impotent, and several other opprobrious names, which did not affect
him near so much as the ridicule of his person: upon many occasions
after, they repeated this, and particularly in a song they ridiculed
the horse of Siré, who had run away at the battle of Limjour, where
Michael cried out, Send these horse to the mill. It happened that
these wretches, men and women, to the number of about thirty and
upwards, were then, with very different songs, celebrating Ras
Michael's return to Gondar. The King and Ras, after the proclamation,
had just turned to the right to Aylo Meidan, below the palace, a large
field where the troops exercise. Confu and the king's household troops
were before, and about 200 of the Siré horse were behind; on a signal
made by the Ras, these horse turned short and fell upon the singers,
and cut them all to pieces. In less than two minutes they were all
laid dead upon the field, excepting one young man, who, mortally
wounded, had just strength enough to arrive within twenty yards of the
king's horse, and there fell dead without speaking a word.

All the people present, most of them veteran soldiers, and
consequently inured to blood, appeared shocked and disgusted at this
wanton piece of cruelty. For my part, a kind of faintishness, or
feebleness, had taken possession of my heart, ever since the execution
of the two men on our march about the kantuffa; and this second act of
cruelty occasioned such a horror, joined with an absence of mind, that
I found myself unable to give an immediate answer, though the king had
spoken twice to me.

It was about nine o'clock in the morning when we entered Gondar;
every person we met on the street wore the countenance of a condemned
malefactor; the Ras went immediately to the palace with the king,
who retired, as usual, to a kind of cage or lattice-window,
where he always sits unseen when in council. We were then in the
council-chamber, and four of the judges seated; none of the governors
of provinces were present but Ras Michael, and Kasmati Tesfos of
Siré. Abba Salama was brought to the foot of the table without irons,
at perfect liberty. The accuser for the king (it is a post in this
country in no great estimation) began the charge against him with
great force and eloquence: he stated, one by one, the crimes committed
by him at different periods, the sum of which amounted to prove Salama
to be the greatest monster upon earth: among these were various kinds
of murder, especially by poison; incest, with every degree collateral
and descendant. He concluded this black, horrid list, with the charge
of high treason, or cursing the king, and absolving his subjects from
their allegiance, which he stated as the greatest crime human nature
was capable of, as involving in its consequences all sorts of other
crimes. Abba Salama, though he seemed under very great impatience,
did not often interrupt him, further than, _You lie_, and, _It is
a lie_, which he repeated at every new charge. His accuser had not
said one word of the murder of Joas, but passed it over without the
smallest allusion to it.

In this, however, Abba Salama did not follow his example: being
desired to answer in his own defence, he entered upon it with great
dignity, and an air of superiority, very different from his behaviour
in the king's tent the day before: he laughed, and made extremely
light of the charges on the article of women, which he neither
confessed nor denied; but said these might be crimes among the Franks,
(looking at me) or other Christians, but not the Christians of that
country, who lived under a double dispensation, the law of Moses and
the law of Christ: he said the Abyssinians were _Beni Israel_, as
indeed they call themselves, that is, Children of Israel; and that
in every age the patriarchs had acted as he did, and were not less
beloved of God. He went roundly into the murder of Joas, and of his
two brothers, Adigo and Aylo, on the mountain of Wechné, and charged
Michael directly with it, as also with the poisoning the late Hatzé
Hannes, father of the present king.

The Ras seemed to avoid hearing, sometimes by speaking to people
standing behind him, sometimes by reading a paper; in particular,
he asked me, standing directly behind his chair, in a low voice,
What is the punishment in your country for such a crime? It was his
custom to speak to me in his own language of Tigrè, and one of his
greatest pastimes to laugh at my faulty expression. He spake this to
me in Amharic, so I knew he wanted my answer should be understood:
I therefore said, in the same low tone of voice he had spoke to me,
High-treason is punished with death in all the countries I have ever
known.--This I owed to Abba Salama, and it was not long before I had
my return.

Abba Salama next went into the murder of Kasmati Eshté, which he
confessed he was the promoter of. He said the Iteghé, with her
brothers and Ayto Aylo, had all turned Franks, so had Gusho of Amhara;
and that, in order to make the country Catholic, they had sent for
priests, who lived with them in confidence, as that Frank did,
pointing to me: that it was against the law of the country, that I
should be suffered here; that I was accursed, and should be stoned as
an enemy to the Virgin Mary. There the Ras interrupted him, by saying,
Confine yourself to your own defence; clear yourself first, and then
accuse any one you please: it is the king's intention to put the law
in execution against all offenders, and it is only as believing you
the greatest that he has begun with you.

This calmness of the Ras seemed to disconcert the Acab Saat; he lost
all method; he warned the Ras that it was owing to his excommunicating
Kasmati Eshté that room was made for him to come to Gondar; without
that event this king would never have been upon the throne, so that
he had still done them as much good by his excommunications as he had
done them harm: he told the Ras, and the judges that they were all
doubly under a curse, if they offered either to pull out his eyes,
or cut out his tongue; and prayed them, bursting into tears, not so
much as to think of either, if it was only for old fellowship, or
friendship which had long subsisted between them.

There is an officer named Kal Hatzé who stands always upon steps at
the side of the lattice-window, where there is a hole covered in the
inside with a curtain of green taffeta; behind this curtain the king
sits, and through this hole he sends what he has to say to the Board,
who rise and receive the messenger standing: he had not interfered
till now, when the officer said, addressing himself to Abba Salama,
"The king requires of you to answer directly why you persuaded the
Abuna to excommunicate him? the Abuna is a slave of the Turks, and
has no king; you are born under a monarchy, why did you, who are his
inferior in office, take upon you to advise him at all? or why, after
having presumed to advise him, did you advise him wrong, and abuse his
ignorance in these matters?" This question, which was a home one, made
him lose all his temper; he cursed the Abuna, called him Mahometan,
Pagan, Frank, and Infidel; and was going on in this wild manner, when
Tecla Haimanout[5], the eldest of the judges, got up, and addressing
himself to the Ras, It is no part of my duty to hear all this railing,
he has not so much as offered one fact material to his exculpation.

The king's secretary sent up to the window the substance of his
defence, the criminal was carried at some distance to the other end of
the room, and the judges deliberated whilst the king was reading. Very
few words were said among the rest; the Ras was all the time speaking
to other people: after he had ended this, he called upon the youngest
judge to give his opinion, and he gave it, 'He is guilty, and should
die;' the same said all the officers, and after them the judges, and
the same said Kasmati Tesfos after them. When it came to Ras Michael
to give his vote, he affected moderation; he said that he was accused
for being his enemy and accomplice; in either case, it is not fair
that he should judge him. No superior officer being present, the last
voice remained with the king, who sent Kal Hatzé to the Board with
his sentence; 'He is guilty and _shall_ die _the death_.--The hangman
_shall_ hang him upon a tree _to-day_.' The unfortunate Acab Saat was
immediately hurried away by the guards to the place of execution,
which is a large tree before the king's gate; where uttering, to the
very last moment, curses against the king, the Ras, and the Abuna,
he suffered the death he very richly deserved, being hanged in the
very vestments in which he used to sit before the king, without one
ornament of his civil or sacerdotal pre-eminence having been taken
from him before the execution. In going to the tree he said he had 400
cows, which he bequeathed to some priests to say prayers for his soul;
but the Ras ordered them to be brought to Gondar, and distributed
among his soldiers.

I have entered into a longer detail of this trial, at the whole of
which I assisted, the rather that I might ask this question of those
that maintain the absolute independence of the Abyssinian priesthood,
Whether, if the many instances already mentioned have not had the
effect, this one does not fully convince them, that all ecclesiastical
persons are subject to the secular power in Abyssinia as much as they
are in Britain or any European Protestant state whatever?

Chremation, Socinios's brother, was next called, he seemed half dead
with fear; he only denied having any concern in his brother being
elected king. He said he had no post, and in this he spoke the
truth, but confessed that he had been sent by Abba Salama to bring
the Itcheguè and the Abuna to meet him the day of excommunication at
Dippabye. It was further unluckily proved against him, that he was
present with his brother at plundering the houses in the night-time
when the man was killed; and upon this he was sentenced to be
immediately hanged; the court then broke up and went to breakfast.
All this had passed in less than two hours; it was not quite eleven
o'clock when all was over, but Ras Michael had sworn he would not
taste bread till Abba Salama was hanged, and on such occasions he
never broke his word.

Immediately after this last execution the kettle-drums beat at the
palace-gate, and the crier made this proclamation, "That all lands and
villages, which are now, or have been given to the Abuna by the king,
shall revert to the king's own use, and be subject to the government,
or the Cantiba of Dembea, or such officers as the king shall after
appoint in the provinces where they are situated."

I went home, and my house being but a few yards from the palace, I
passed the two unfortunate people hanging upon the same branch; and,
full of the cruelty of the scene I had witnessed, which I knew was but
a preamble to much more, I determined firmly, at all events, to quit
this country.

The next morning came on the trial of the unfortunate Guebra Denghel,
Sebaat Laab, and Kefla Mariam; the Ras claimed his right of trying
these three at his own house, as they were all three subjects of
his government of Tigrè. Guebra Denghel bore his hard fortune with
great unconcern, declaring, that his only reason of taking up arms
against the king was, that he saw no other way of preventing Michael's
tyranny, and monstrous thirst of money and of power: that the Ras
was really king, had subverted the constitution, annihilated all
difference of rank and persons, and transferred the efficient parts
of government into the hands of his own creatures. He wished the king
might know this was his only motive for rebellion, and that unless it
had been to make this declaration, he would not have opened his mouth
before so partial and unjust a judge as he considered Michael to be.

But Welleta Selassé, his daughter, hearing the danger her father
was in, broke suddenly out of Ozoro Esther's apartment, which was
contiguous; and, coming into the council-room at the instant her
father was condemned to die, threw herself at the Ras's feet with
every mark and expression of the most extreme sorrow. I cannot,
indeed, repeat what her expressions were, as I was not present, and I
thank God that I was not; I believe they are ineffable by any mouth
but her own, but they were perfectly unsuccessful. The old tyrant
threatened her with immediate death, spurned her away with his foot,
and in her hearing ordered her father to be immediately hanged.
Welleta Selassé, in a fit, or faint, which resembled death, fell
speechless to the ground; the father, forgetful of his own situation,
flew to his daughter's assistance, and they were both dragged out
at separate doors, the one to death, the other to after sufferings,
greater than death itself.

Fortune seemed to have taken delight, from very early life, constantly
to traverse the greatness and happiness of this young lady. She
was first destined to be married to Joas, and the affair was near
concluded, when the fatal discovery, made at the battle of Azazo,
that the king had sent his household troops privately to fight for
Fasil against Michael, prevented her marriage, and occasioned his
death. She was then destined to old Hatzé Hannes, Tecla Haimanout's
father: Michael, who found him incapable of being a king, judged him
as incapable of being a husband to a woman of the youth and charms of
Welleta Selassé, and, therefore, deprived him at once of his life,
crown, and bride. She was now not seventeen, and it was designed
she should be married to the present king; Providence put a stop to
a union that was not agreeable to either party: she died some time
after this, before the battle of Serbraxos; being strongly pressed
to gratify the brutal inclinations of the Ras her grandfather, whom,
when she could not resist or avoid, she took poison; others said it
was given her by Ozoro Esther from jealousy, but this was certainly
without foundation. I saw her in her last moments, but too late to
give her any assistance; and she had told her women-servants and
slaves that she had taken arsenic, having no other way to avoid
committing so monstrous a crime as incest with the murderer of her
father.

The rage that the intercession of the daughter for her father Guebra
Denghel had put the Ras into, was seen in the severity of the sentence
he passed upon the other two criminals; Kefla Mariam's eyes were
pulled out, Sebaat Laab's eye-lids were cut off by the roots, and
both of them were exposed in the market-place to the burning sun,
without any covering whatever. Sebaat Laab died of a fever in a few
days; Kefla Mariam lived, if not to see, at least to hear, that he was
revenged, after the battle of Serbraxos, by the disgrace and captivity
of Michael.

I will spare myself the disagreeable task of shocking my readers with
any further account of these horrid cruelties; enough has been said
to give an idea of the character of these times and people. Blood
continued to be spilt as water, day after day, till the Epiphany;
priests, lay-men, young men and old, noble and vile, daily found their
end by the knife or the cord. Fifty-seven people died publicly by
the hand of the executioner in the course of a very few days; many
disappeared, and were either murdered privately, or sent to prisons,
no one knew where.

The bodies of those killed by the sword were hewn to pieces and
scattered about the streets, being denied burial. I was miserable, and
almost driven to despair, at seeing my hunting-dogs, twice let loose
by the carelessness of my servants, bringing into the court-yard the
head and arms of slaughtered men, and which I could no way prevent but
by the destruction of the dogs themselves; the quantity of carrion,
and the stench of it, brought down the hyænas in hundreds from the
neighbouring mountains; and, as few people in Gondar go out after it
is dark, they enjoyed the streets to themselves, and seemed ready
to dispute the possession of the city with the inhabitants. Often
when I went home late from the palace, and it was this time the king
chose chiefly for conversation, though I had but to pass the corner
of the market-place before the palace, had lanthorns with me, and
was surrounded with armed men, I heard them grunting by two's and
three's so near me as to be afraid they would take some opportunity of
seizing me by the leg; a pistol would have frightened them, and made
them speedily run, and I constantly carried two loaded at my girdle,
but the discharging a pistol in the night would have alarmed every
one that heard it in the town, and it was not now the time to add any
thing to people's fears. I at last scarce ever went out, and nothing
occupied my thoughts but how to escape from this bloody country by way
of Sennaar, and how I could best exert my power and influence over
Yasine at Ras el Feel to pave my way, by assisting me to pass the
desert into Atbara.

The king missing me some days at the palace, and hearing I had not
been at Ras Michael's, began to inquire who had been with me. Ayto
Confu soon found Yasine, who informed him of the whole matter; upon
this I was sent for to the palace, where I found the king, without
any body but menial servants. He immediately remarked that I looked
very ill; which, indeed, I felt to be the case, as I had scarcely
ate or slept since I saw him last, or even for some days before. He
asked me, in a condoling tone, What ailed me? that, besides looking
sick, I seemed as if something had ruffled me, and put me out of
humour. I told him that what he observed was true: that, coming
across the market-place, I had seen Za Mariam, the Ras's doorkeeper,
with three men bound, one of whom he fell a-hacking to pieces in my
presence. Upon seeing me running across the place, stopping my nose,
he called me to stay till he should come and dispatch the other
two, for he wanted to speak to me, as if he had been engaged about
ordinary business: that the soldiers, in consideration of his haste,
immediately fell upon the other two, whose cries were still remaining
in my ears: that the hyænas at night would scarcely let me pass in the
streets when I returned from the palace; and the dogs fled into my
house to eat pieces of human carcases at leisure.

Although his intention was to look grave, I saw it was all he could
do to stifle a laugh at grievances he thought very little of. "The
men you saw with Za Mariam just now, says he, are rebels, sent by
Kefla Yasous for examples: he has forced a junction with Tecla and
Welleta Michael in Samen, and a road is now open through Woggora,
and plenty established in Gondar. The men you saw suffer were those
that cut off the provisions from coming into the city; they have
occasioned the death of many poor people; as for the hyæna he never
meddles with living people, he seeks carrion, and will soon clear
the streets of those incumbrances that so much offend you; people
say that they are the Falasha of the mountains, who take that shape
of the hyæna, and come down into the town to eat Christian flesh in
the night."--"If they depend upon Christian flesh, and eat no other,
said I, perhaps the hyænas of Gondar will be the worst fed of any in
the world."--"True, says he, bursting out into a loud laughter, that
may be, few of those that die by the knife anywhere are Christians,
or have any religion at all; why then should you mind what they
suffer?"--"Sir, said I, that is not my sentiment; if you was to order
a dog to be tortured to death before me every morning, I could not
bear it. The carcases of Abba Salama, Guebra Denghel, and the rest,
are still hanging where they were upon the tree; you smell the stench
of them at the palace-gate, and will soon, I apprehend, in the palace
itself. This cannot be pleasant, and I do assure you it must be very
pernicious to your health, if there was nothing else in it. At the
battle of Fagitta, though you had no intention to retreat, yet you
went half a day backward, to higher ground, and purer air, to avoid
the stench of the field, but here in the city you heap up carrion
about your houses, where is your continual residence."

"The Ras has given orders, says he gravely, to remove all the dead
bodies before the Epiphany, when we go down to keep that festival, and
wash away all this pollution in the clear-running water of the Kahha:
but tell me now, Yagoube, is it really possible that you can take such
things as these so much to heart? You are a brave man; we all know you
are, and have seen it: we have all blamed you, stranger as you are in
this country, for the little care you take of yourself; and yet about
these things you are as much affected as the most cowardly woman,
girl, or child could be."--"Sir, said I, I do not know if I am brave
or not; but if to see men tortured or murdered, or to live among dead
bodies without concern, be courage, I have it not, nor desire to have
it: war is the profession of noble minds; it is a glorious one; it is
the science and occupation of kings; and many wise and many humane men
have dedicated their whole life to the study of it in every country;
it softens men's manners, by obliging them to society, to assist,
befriend, and even save one another, though at their own risk and
danger. A barbarian of that profession should be pointed at. Observe
Ayto Engedan, (who came at that very instant into the room) there is
a young man, said I, who, with the bravery, has also the humanity and
gentleness of my countrymen that are soldiers."

Engedan fell on his face before the king, as is usual, while the king
went on seriously--"War you want; do you, Yagoube? war you shall have;
it is not far distant, and Engedan is come to tell us how near." They
then went into a considerable conversation about Gusho, Powussen, and
the preparations they were making, and where they were, with which I
shall not trouble the reader, as I shall have an occasion to speak
of the particulars afterwards as they arise. "I want Confu, says the
king; I want him to send his men of Ras el Feel to Sennaar, and to
the Baharnagash to get horses and some coats of mail. And what do
you think of sending Yagoube there? he knows their manners and their
language, and has friends there to whom he is intending to escape,
without so much as asking my leave."--"Pardon me, Sir, said I; if I
have ever entertained that thought, it is proof sufficient of the
extreme necessity I am under to go." "Sir, says Engedan, I have rode
in the Koccob horse; I will do so again, if Yagoube commands them, and
will stay with us till we try the horse of Begemder. I have eight or
ten coats of mail, which I will give your majesty: they belonged to
my father, Confu, and I took them lately from that thief Abou Barea,
with whom they were left at my father's death; but I will tell your
Majesty, I had rather fight naked without a coat of mail, than that
you should send Yagoube to Sennaar to purchase them from thence, for
he will never return."

Ras Michael was now announced, and we made haste to get away. I would
have Confu, Engedan, and you, come here to-morrow night, says the
king, as soon as it is dark; and do not you, Yagoube, for your life,
speak one word of Sennaar, till you know my will upon it. He said this
in the sternest manner, and with all the dignity and majesty of a
king.

We passed the Ras in the anti-chamber, attended by a great many
people. We endeavoured to slide by him in the crowd, but he noticed
us, and brought us before him. We both kissed his hands, and he
kept hold of one of mine, while he asked Engedan, "Is Fasil at
Ibaba?" to which he was answered, "Yes." "Who is with him? says the
Ras."--"Damot, Agow, and Maitsha," answered Engedan. "Was you there?
says the Ras." "No, answered Engedan, I am at Tshemera, with few men."
He then turned to me, and said, "My son is ill; Ozoro Esther has just
sent to me, and complains you visit her now no more. Go see the boy,
and don't neglect Ozoro Esther, she is one of your best friends." I
inquired if she was at Gondar, and was answered, No; she is at Koscam.
We parted; Engedan went to Koscam to Ozoro Esther's, and I went home
to plan my route to Sennaar, and to prepare letters for Hagi Belal, a
merchant there, to whom I was recommended from Arabia Felix.

   _The King promises Leave to the Author to depart--Receives
   a Reinforcement from Shoa--Amiable Carriage of Amha
   Yasous--Striking Contrast between him and a Prince of the
   Galla--Bad State of the King's Affairs._


It was the 31st of December that we were at Koscam. A proclamation
had been made some days before of a general pardon to all that would
return to Gondar; but no one had ventured but Ayto Engedan, who was
with Fasil as the king's friend; nor were any of those who went with
Fasil the object of the proclamation, for it was not thought that the
retiring from Socinios with Fasil was doing any thing against their
allegiance.

That night the bodies of Guebra Denghel, Kefla Mariam, and Sebaat
Laab, were taken down from the tree and laid upon the ground; after
having been watched in the night by their friends to keep the beasts
from them, were at last suffered to be taken privately away, at the
intercession of the troops of Tigrè, whose countrymen they were.
Chremation and Abba Salama were abandoned to their fortune, and in
part putrefied; they were covered with heaps of stones thrown upon
them by such as were passing, and had no other burial.

The next night, the 1st of January 1771, according to order, I waited
upon the king with Confu and Engedan, and with them Yasine: measures
were then taken for buying their horses and coats of mail; the Ras had
advanced part of the money, the rest was to be made up by the meery,
or king's duty, due by the Mahometan provinces, which had not been
paid since he went to Tigrè; a Mahometan servant of the king was sent
for from the customhouse; with him was to go a man from Yasine, and
with them I sent my letters by the hand of Soliman, a black of Ras el
Feel, a man remarkable for his strength, courage, and size, and very
shrewd and discerning, under the appearance of an idiot: Yasine was
sent with them to get a safe conduct from his friend Fidele Shekh of
Atbara, who was to convoy them to Beyla, and thence to Sennaar.

It was not without great dispute and altercation the king would
allow me the permission to send letters; at last, seeing he could do
no better, it was agreed that, as an immediate engagement between
Powussen, Gusho, and Ras Michael, was inevitable, I should swear not
to attempt to leave him till that affair was settled some way or
other; but the king insisted I should also take an oath, that, should
he be victorious over, or reconciled to the rebels, if the engagement
I was under in my own country was not fulfilled, and I recovered my
health, I should bring as many of my brethren and family as possible,
with their horses, muskets, and bayonets; that, if I could not pass
by Sennaar, I should come by the way of the East Indies from Surat to
Masuah, which, by how much it was more tedious, was by so much more
secure, than that by Sennaar.

I cannot but hope, the impossibility of performing this oath
extinguished the sin of breaking it; at any rate, it was personal, and
the subsequent death of the king[6] must have freed me from it; be
that as it will, it had this good effect, that it greatly composed my
mind for the time, as I now no longer considered myself as involved
in that ancient and general rule of the country, Never to allow a
stranger to return to his home. We that night learned, that the king
had been in great straits ever since he came from Tigrè; that the Ras,
who was possessed of all the revenues of the provinces that were in
their allegiance, had never yet given the king an ounce of gold; and
that he furnished his daily subsistence from his own house, a cow for
his own and great officers table, and two loaves of bread for each of
his servants; as small an allowance as any private person gave. It
was believed that the Ras had left most of his money in Tigrè, and
had trusted to the contributions he was to levy upon the great men
whenever he should cross the Tacazzé; but in this he disappointed
himself by his cruelty, for no person came before him, on his arrival
at Gondar, from whom he could raise a farthing.

It was about the 20th of January, that a message arrived from
Powussen, to tell the Ras he had taken the usurper Socinios prisoner,
and held him in irons at the king's disposal. He upbraided Michael
with the cruelties of his executions, and declared his resolution of
calling him to an account for these personally at Gondar; he warned
him in time, to repass the Tacazzé, and retire while it was in his
power to his government of Tigrè, where nobody would molest him, and
leave the king at liberty to act for himself. Gusho likewise sent a
messenger, but what word he brought did not transpire; after seeing
the King and Ras Michael, both these messengers proceeded to Fasil.
Soon after this came a message from Fasil, desiring only that the King
and the Ras might renew to him the grant of his father's lands and
estates, which he formerly possessed: what was the meaning of this
message I could never learn; he was already in full possession of what
he asked, and more; no person had attempted to take any thing from
him, nor was it indeed in their power.

Proclamation was made accordingly in terms of the request, and all the
lands that he had possessed were given him: before he could have news
of this first grant, a second messenger came, desiring that he might
be confirmed in his government of Maitsha, Damot, and Agow. This too
was immediately granted him, but a condition was added, that he should
bring the troops of these provinces, and as many others as he could
raise, to join the king with all possible speed, and take the field
with Ras Michael against Powussen and Gusho; and this was but what
he had spontaneously promised when he made his peace at Dingleber. At
the same time Ayto Aylo, brother to Engedan, was proclaimed governor
of Begemder; and all people holding of the king or of Aylo's friends,
(for he had a very large estate in that province) were ordered to join
him; but a very few came, among whom was the famous Guigarr, chief of
the clan, Waag of Lasta, son to Aylo's sister.

Mean time the king used all the means in his power to induce the
Iteghé to return to Koscam, for her presence in Gojam kept alive the
spirit of a number of people that were attached to her, who bore very
impatiently to see her banished, as she then was, though resident with
her daughter Ozoro Welleta Israel, and surrounded by the forces of
Aylo her grandson, who was governor of Gojam, and to whom half of that
province belonged in property. But the queen was resolute never to
trust Ras Michael, though it was believed she sent the king a sum in
gold privately by Engedan.

It was in the end of January that another message arrived from Fasil,
excusing his coming to Gondar on account of the badness of his health;
he said, besides, he could not trust Michael unless he gave him
Welleta Selassé, his granddaughter, to wife, and sent her to him to
Buré. I have already mentioned that the Ras was fond of this young
lady himself, and nothing but that hindered him from giving her to
the king in marriage; and it was said, and I believe with truth, that
some delicacy[7] the king had expressed about this since his return
from Tigrè, was the reason of coldness between him and the Ras, and of
Michael's putting the king on so short allowance on his first coming
to Gondar: but all that was now removed by the necessities of the
times; gold came from Tigrè in plenty; even Powussen had sent some
of the revenue of Begemder, all the other provinces, a proportion,
with butter, cattle, and cotton cloths, for the maintenance of the
king's household and troops: for my part, though I enjoyed the name
of several posts, I had partaken since this last revolution of a very
small part of their revenues; I had been liberally supplied in the
king's absence by Ozoro Esther and the queen. I had few servants, and
lived cheaply in the Iteghé's palace at Koscam; but after my arrival,
the king, on purpose I believe to disconcert my journey, ran me
grievously into debt with the soldiers, and other expences that were,
as I was told, absolutely necessary; it is true, these were paid in
part at times but very irregularly. Ras Michael was not a man to be
craved, nor was my temper such as could be brought to crave him; from
this it arose that often I had been in great straits, and obliged to
live sparingly, which luckily was never a great hardship upon me,
in order to fulfill my promise to others. And now the campaign was
beginning, horses, and mules, and every thing necessary were to be
purchased, and I was in debt above one hundred pounds, nor would it
have been possible I ever should have cleared myself, for my daily
expences were enormous, if it had not been for the situation that a
certain Greek, named Petros, was in, from whom I borrowed about three
hundred pounds, as I shall after mention. With regard to Kasmati
Fasil, he sent me, twice, two large jars of honey from my lordship
of Geesh, at two different times: the first was taken by Coque Abou
Barea, the last tasted so bitter of lupines, that no use could be
made of it. I was a Sovereign, it is true, and my revenue was what
wise men have said is the best,--the love of the people. It went,
however, but little way towards supporting my dignity.

While the king was at Kahha, keeping the festival of the Epiphany,
he received a very extraordinary visit from Amha Yasous, son of the
governor of Shoa, offering his personal service and assistance to the
king, and brought with him, as a present, 500 ounces of gold, and
a thousand excellent horsemen ready equipt at all points. Upon his
being presented to the king, two young noblemen were instructed to be
ready to lay hold of him by the arms, and prevent his throwing himself
upon the ground if he intended so to do. The king was seated upon the
throne, very richly dressed in brocade, a very fine muslin web wrapt
loosely about him, so as to hang in plaits, and in some parts show,
and in some conceal, the flowers of the cloth of gold of which his
waistcoat was composed. His hair was loose, combed out at its full
length, and falling about his head in every direction, and a fork,
like a skewer, made of a rhinoceros horn, with a gold button or head
upon it, stuck thro' his hair near his temples; he was all perfumed
with rose water, and two people stood on the opposite sides of the
tent, each of them with a silver bottle full of it.

Amha Yasous with his thousand horse presented himself before the
door of the tent, and rode on till he was compleatly in it; he then
descended as in a great hurry or surprise, and ran forward, stooping,
to the foot of the throne, inclining his body lower and lower as he
approached; and, just before the act of prostration, he was seized by
Tecla Mariam and Guebra Menfus Kedus, and prevented from kissing the
ground; the king held his hand uncovered, but not extended, that is,
as if he did not intend or expect that he should kiss it. Amha Yasous,
after the struggle was over about the prostration, suddenly seized the
king's hand and kissed it, with some resistance on the part of the
king, who, when he had kissed the back of his hand, turned the palm
likewise; a great mark of familiarity and confidence in this country.
There was a small stool, about half a foot from the ground, covered
with a Persian carpet. Amha Yasous attempted to speak standing, but
was not suffered, but constrained by the two noblemen to sit down on
the little stool; they then deluged him so with rose-water, that I do
believe he never in his life was so wet with rain. After some general
questions the tent was cleared. All this ceremonial was premeditated
and studied; the etiquette could not have been more punctually and
uniformly observed in any court of Europe, and would have just
signified what it did here.

Amha Yasous was a man from twenty-six to twenty-eight years of age,
tall, and of a just degree of corpulence, with arms and legs finely
made; he had a very beautiful face, small features, and the most
affable manners. I have thought, when I have seen them together,
that the king, Engedan, and himself, were three of the handsomest
men I had ever beheld in any country; besides this, all three had
fine understandings, noble sentiments, and courage superior to the
greatest danger; charitable too, and humane inclinations, were it not
for that accursed indifference, or rather propensity, one of them had
to shed human blood; this the young king had imbibed in the school
of Michael, but for natural talents he certainly was the first of the
three.

Apartments in the palace, and a table, were assigned to Amha Yasous,
and he was served by the king's servants as well as his own; a guard
was appointed at his door, the officer of which attended to receive
his orders and take the word daily. This was the manner of receiving
illustrious strangers in my time at Gondar. Anthulé, a Greek, master
of the king's wardrobe, was ordered from time to time to bring him
clothes of the same kind with those the king wore. All the Ozoros, or
noble women at court, fell violently in love with Amha Yasous, as fame
reported, except Ozoro Esther. The young prince had not a grain of
coldness nor indifference in his nature; he carried himself, wherever
he went, with honourable, attentive, and decent gallantry. But his
chief attention was paid to Welleta Selassé; nor was Ras Michael
jealous, nor, as public report went, was Welleta Selassé unkind.
I was often in the evenings in his parties at her house; a fixed,
never-changing melancholy hung upon her face; deep, and involuntary
sighs escaped from her under visible constraint: it did not appear to
me possible this could have been her behaviour, if in actual enjoyment
of successful love; or that, after having gratified it, she could have
put in execution that desperate resolution which apparently she had
then formed in her mind.

Amha Yasous was son of a sister of Gusho; it was said afterwards that
he had a commission from his father, governor of Shoa, to detach
Gusho, if possible, from his alliance with Powussen, and bring him
back to his allegiance to the king. Whether this was true or not I
cannot say, but that this, or something similar, was the case, seemed
to be more than probable from the behaviour of Gusho afterwards,
during the whole campaign. Amha Yasous did not come to take part in
the war, he only brought, in imitation of old times, a tribute to
the king as a testimony of the loyalty of the faithful province of
Shoa; but he was so interested for the king, after being admitted
into intimacy with him, and so pleased with the society of the young
noblemen at court, that he determined to come back with the command of
the troops of his father, and in his way force Gusho to return to his
duty, if he was not already determined.

He had heard, while at Shoa, from some priests of Debra Libanos,
that there was a strange white man in favour with the king at
Gondar, who could do every thing but raise the dead; it was among
his first requests to the king, to make him acquainted with me. The
king therefore ordered me to wait upon him every morning, and I, on
my part, did not let slip that opportunity. Insensibly we came to
be inseparable companions. Our conversation fell one day to be upon
the Abyssinian kings who first lived at Shoa at the time when the
kingdom of Adel was a great mart for the East Indian trade, before the
discovery of the Cape of Good Hope. He said that a book containing
their history, he believed, was in some of the churches in Shoa, and
that he would immediately send for it. Although I could not help
testifying my desire of having a book which I had sought for in vain
through the rest of the provinces of Abyssinia, yet I thought it
unreasonable to desire a man to send 300 miles merely for the purpose
of getting it; I therefore did not press it, being satisfied with his
promise; but as my work would have been incomplete without it, I
asked my friend Tecla Mariam to mention it to him as from the king.
His answer was, "I have already promised to get it for Yagoube, the
messenger by this time is in Amhara; depend upon it, my father will
not fail to let me have it; for fear of mistake, I have dispatched
a very intelligent man, who knows and has seen the book at Debra
Libanos." The promise was punctually kept, the book came, and from it
I have drawn the history of the Adelan war, and the reign of those
kings who had not yet returned to Axum, but reigned in Shoa.

One evening I inquired of him concerning the story which the
Portuguese heard, at the discovery of Benin, that the blacks of
that country had intercourse with a Christian inland state they
acknowledged as sovereign, from which they procured the investiture of
their lands, as has been already mentioned in the beginning of this
work? whether any such commerce did exist with Shoa at present, or if
traces remained of it in older times? if there was any other Christian
or Jewish state in his neighbourhood to which this description could
apply[8]? He said they knew nothing of Benin at Shoa, nor had he ever
heard of the name, nor any custom of the kind that I had mentioned,
which either then did, or ever had prevailed in Shoa: he knew of no
Christian state farther to the southward, excepting Narea, a great
part of which was conquered by the Galla, who were Pagans. The blacks
that were next to Shoa, he said, were exceedingly fierce, warlike, and
cruel; worse than the Galla, and of the same kind with the Shangalla
in Abyssinia. The other nations were partly Mahometan, but chiefly
Galla, and some of these had turned Mahometan; but that they had no
knowledge of any commerce with the Western, or Atlantic Ocean, though
they knew the Eastern or Indian Ocean, which was nearer; were often
served with Indian goods from Mahometan merchants from thence; but
that the Galla had over-run most of the intermediate countries, and
made the ways dangerous.

After Amha Yasous's audience with the king, he waited on Ras Michael
also, to whom he brought a present in gold; politely excusing himself
for having brought it in that form, on account that any other would
have been troublesome, from the length of the way. He well knew,
however, that an apology was needless, and that Ras Michael never
saw any present in a more agreeable form than that of gold. I was
not at the audience, nor do I know what passed at it; only that, on
his introduction, the Ras was held up on his feet, and received him
standing; they then both sat down upon the same seat, after which they
dined heartily together at Ozoro Esther's apartment, who came from
Koscam on purpose to prepare their entertainment, and they drank and
conversed together till late at night.

The sight of gold, and a thousand horse at the juncture, made Ras
Michael as light and chearful as a young man of twenty-five. No
words concerning the government of Shoa passed, nor any proclamation
relative to the state of that province; and this silence was equal to
declare it independent, as it was intended, and indeed it had been
considered as such a long time before. As I saw Amha Yasous eat raw
beef like the Abyssinians, I asked him if it was the custom of other
nations to the southward? He said he believed so, if they were not
Mahometans; and inquired of me if it was not likewise the practice
among us. I imagine it prevails as far as the Cape of Good Hope.

Another interview, which happened at Kahha, was much more
extraordinary in itself, though of much less importance to the state.
Guangoul, chief of the Galla of Angot, that is, of the eastern Galla,
came to pay his respects to the king and Ras Michael; he had with him
about 500 foot and 40 horse: he brought with him a number of large
horns for carrying the king's wine, and some other such trifles.
He was a little, thin, cross-made man, of no apparent strength or
swiftness, as far as could be conjectured; his legs and thighs being
thin and small for his body, and his head large; he was of a yellow,
unwholesome colour, not black nor brown; he had long hair plaited
and interwoven with the bowels of oxen, and so knotted and twisted
together as to render it impossible to distinguish the hair from the
bowels, which hung down in long strings, part before his breast and
part behind his shoulder, the most extraordinary ringlets I had ever
seen. He had likewise, a wreath of guts hung about his neck, and
several rounds of the same about his middle, which served as a girdle,
below which was a short cotton cloth dipt in butter, and all his body
was wet, and running down with the same; he seemed to be about fifty
years of age, with a confident and insolent superiority painted in his
face. In his country it seems, when he appears in state, the beast
he rides upon is a cow. He was then in full dress and ceremony, and
mounted upon one, not of the largest sort, but which had monstrous
horns. He had no saddle on his cow. He had short drawers, that did
not reach the middle of his thighs; his knees, feet, legs, and all
his body were bare. He had a shield of a single hide, warped by the
heat in several directions, and much in the shape of a high-crowned,
large, straw-hat, with which the fashionable women in our own country
sometimes disguise themselves. He carried a short lance in his right
hand, with an ill-made iron head, and a shaft that seemed to be of
thorn-tree, but altogether without ornament, which is seldom the case
with the arms of barbarians. Whether it was necessary for the poizing
himself upon the sharp ridge of the beast's back, or whether it was
meant as graceful riding, I do not know, being quite unskilled in
cowmanship; but he leaned exceedingly backwards, pushing his belly
forwards, and holding his left arm and shield stretched out on one
side of him, and his right arm and lance in the same way on the other,
like wings.

The king was seated on his ivory chair, to receive him, almost in the
middle of his tent; the day was very hot, and an insufferable stench
of carrion soon made every one in the tent sensible of the approach
of this nasty sovereign, even before they saw him. The king, when
he perceived him coming, was so struck with the whole figure and
appearance, that he could not contain himself from an immoderate fit
of laughter, which finding it impossible to stifle, he rose from his
chair, and ran as hard as he could into another apartment behind the
throne.

The savage got off from his cow at the door of the tent with all his
tripes about him; and, while we were admiring him as a monster, seeing
the king's seat empty, he took it for his own, and down he sat upon
the crimson silk cushion, with the butter running from every part
of him. A general cry of astonishment was made by every person in
the tent: he started up I believe without divining the cause, and
before he had time to recollect himself, they fell all upon him, and
with pushes and blows drove this greasy chieftain to the door of
the tent, staring with wild amazement, not knowing what was next to
happen. It is high treason, and punishable by immediate death, to
sit down upon the king's chair. Poor Guangoul owed his life to his
ignorance. The king had beheld the whole scene through the curtain;
if he laughed heartily at the beginning, he laughed ten times more
at the catastrophe; he came out laughing, and unable to speak. The
cushion was lifted and thrown away, and a yellow Indian shawl spread
on the ivory stool; and ever after, when it was placed, and the king
not there, the stool was turned on its face upon the carpet to prevent
such like accidents.

Guangoul, disappointed of having an audience of the king, went to
the Ras, where he was better received, but what passed I know not.
His troops, armed like himself, with shields of no resistance, and
hedge-stakes burnt and sharpened at the end instead of lances, were
no acquisition to any party, especially in the present quarrel, where
all the veteran troops in Abyssinia were nearly equally divided on
opposite sides; besides, the Shoa horse had taken the eyes of people
so much, that they began to think little of any cavalry that was not
in some degree equipped like them.

After the king returned to the palace, great diversion was made at
Guangoul's appearance, in so much that Ozoro Esther, who hated the
very name of Galla, and of this race in particular, insisted upon
seeing a representation of it. Doho, accordingly, a dwarf belonging
to Ras Michael, very ugly, with a monstrous big head, but very sharp
and clever, and capable of acting his part, was brought to represent
the person of Guangoul: a burnt stick and a bad shield were provided;
but the great difficulty remained, how to persuade Doho the dwarf to
put on the raw guts about his neck and waist, and, above all, to plait
them in the hair, which he absolutely refused, both from religious
and cleanly motives; as for the butter, it was no objection, as all
the Abyssinians anoint themselves with it daily, after bathing.
Here we were very near at a stand, all the ladies having in vain
supplicated him to suffer for their sakes a temporary pollution,
with promises that oceans of rose and scented water should be poured
upon him afterwards, to restore his former sweetness. Doho was a man
who constantly spent his time in reading scripture, the acts of the
councils, the works of St John Chrysostom, and other such books as
they have among them. He remained inflexible: at last I suggested
that several hanks of cotton, dyed blue, red, and yellow, should be
got from the weavers in the Mahometan town, and these oiled, greased,
and knotted properly, and twisted among the hair, well-anointed with
butter, would give a pretty accurate resemblance of what we saw in the
king's tent. All hands were immediately set to work; the cotton was
provided; Ozoro Esther's servants and slaves decked Doho to the life.
I spotted his face with stibium, and others anointed him with butter:
an old milk-cow was found, contrary to my expectation, that suffered a
rider without much impatience, and in came Guangoul into a great hall
in Ozoro Esther's apartment.

Never was any thing better personated or better received; the whole
hall resounded with one cry of laughter; Doho, encouraged by this
and the perfect indifference and steadiness of his cow, began to
act his part with great humour and confidence: he was born in the
neighbourhood of these very Galla, knew their manners, and spoke their
language perfectly. Amha Yasous, Confu, Aylo brother to Engedan, some
servants of the king, acted the part that we did in the tent the day
of the audience, that is, stood on each side of the king's chair: the
cow was brought into the middle of the room, and Guangoul descended
with his lance and shield in great state; a cushion was not spared,
nor did Doho spare the cushion; the butter shewed very distinctly
where he had been sitting: we all fell upon him and belaboured him
heartily, and chaced him to the door. His speedy retreat was not
counterfeited. Ozoro Altash, Esther's sister, and a number of the
ladies of the court, were present. Ozoro Esther declared she would
send for the Ras, he had been in great good humour since the arrival
of Amha Yasous. I had not seen him since the recovery of his son, and
happened to be at the door next him; he took me by the hand, and said,
"Welleta Hawaryat (that is the name of his son) is well, you are very
kind."

Michael was esteemed the best orator in his country, and spoke his
own language, Tigran, with the utmost purity and elegance; yet in
common conversation he was very sententious, two or three words at a
time, but never obscure; this he had contracted by a long practice
of commanding armies, where he saw as instantly and clearly, as he
spoke shortly and distinctly. He bowed very civilly to the ladies, and
pointed to me to sit down on the seat by him. Amha Yasous was standing
before him, I hastened to sit down on the carpet at his feet, and he
seemed to recollect himself and placed Amha Yasous beside him: it was
easy to see his mind was otherwise occupied, and as easy to perceive
by his look, that he gave me credit for my behaviour. When they were
all seated, "Well, says he, in great good humour, what now, what is
the matter? what can I do for you, Yagoube? are the women in your
country as idle and foolish as these? has Ozoro Esther chosen a wife
for you? she shall give you your dinner: I will give her a portion;
and as you are a horseman, the king, with Amha Yasous's leave, said
he bowing, shall give you the command of the Shoa horse; I have seen
them; the men I think are almost as white as yourself." Amha Yasous
bowed in return, and said, "Sir, if the king bestows them so worthily,
I promise to bring another thousand as good as these to join them
after the rains, before next Epiphany."--"And I, says Ozoro Esther,
for my part, I have long had a wife for him, but this is not the
present business, we know your time is precious, Guangoul is without,
and desires an audience of you."--Poh! says the Ras, Guangoul is gone
to Gusho, at Minziro, and there is like to be a pretty story: here
are accounts come from Tigrè, that he has committed great barbarities
in his journey, laid waste some villages, killed the people, for not
furnishing him with provisions: here in Belessen he also burnt a
church and a village belonging to the Iteghé, and killed many poor
people; I do not know what he means; I hope they will keep him where
he is, and not send him home again through Tigrè.

A communication of this kind, very uncommon from the Ras, occasioned
a serious appearance in the whole company; but he had no sooner done
with speaking, than in comes Doho upon his cow: neither man nor woman
that had yet seen him, ever laughed so heartily as the old Ras; he
humoured the thing entirely; welcomed Doho in Galla language, and saw
the whole farce, finished by his flight to the door, with the utmost
good humour. Then taking Amha Yasous with him, and several great
officers who had come in the interim, he returned by a private passage
to his own apartments.

As I shall have no occasion for further mention of this chieftain, I
will here finish his story, though not in the order of time. Gusho and
Powussen had gained Guangoul, and persuaded him to make an irruption
with his Galla into the province of Tigrè, to create a diversion
against Michael, and, for that purpose, they had sent him home nearly
the way he had come through that province. From this encouragement he
had begun to conduct himself still worse than formerly. Ras Michael,
suspecting what would happen, privately dispatched Ayto Confu after
him with 600 horse. That young soldier, happy in a command that highly
gratified his mother, and guided by the cries of the people, followed
with the utmost diligence, and came up with him in the neighbourhood
of Lasta, and there, after little resistance, Guangoul and his troops
were cut to pieces, those that had escaped being all slain by the
exasperated peasants. Confu returned to Gondar the night of the fifth
day, together with the bloody trophies of his conquest over Guangoul
and his Galla.

I have before mentioned that this chief had brought with him a
quantity of large horns for the king's service. Some of this sort
having been seen in India filled with civet, have given occasion
to those travellers who saw them there to say, that the animal
producing these large horns was a carnivorous bull of a prodigious
size, inhabiting the interior parts of Africa. That no illustration
of this kind may be wanting, a copperplate of this curious bull is, I
think, in some of the first volumes of the Philosophical Transactions.
The origin of the tale is believed to be in Bernier or Thevenot. It
may, however, with great certainty, be relied upon, that no such
animal exists in Africa, nor probably in the whole creation. The
animal furnishing those monstrous horns is a cow or bull, which would
be reckoned of a middling size in England; its head and neck are
larger and thicker in proportion, but not very remarkably so. I have
been told this animal was first brought by the Galla from near the
Line, where it rains continually, and the sun is little seen. This
extraordinary size of its horns proceeds from a disease that the
cattle have in those countries, of which they die, and is probably
derived from their pasture and climate.

Whenever the animal shews symptoms of this disorder, he is set apart
in the very best and quietest grazing-place, and never driven nor
molested from that moment. His value lies then in his horns, for his
body becomes emaciated and lank in proportion as the horns grow large.
At the last period of his life the weight of his head is so great
that he is unable to lift it up, or at least for any space of time.
The joints of his neck become callous at last, so that it is not any
longer in his power to lift his head. In this situation he dies, with
scarcely flesh covering his bones, and it is then the horns are of
the greatest size and value. I have seen horns that would contain as
much as a common-sized iron-hooped water-pale, such as they make use
of in the houses in England; but the Galla, who have a ready market
for these of all sizes, generally kill the beast when his horns will
contain something less than six gallons. Two of these horns, filled
with wine or spirits, are carried very commodiously upon a woman's
back, flung over her shoulders. I had two of the largest size stole
from me that night Socinios, Confu, and Chremation plundered my house,
nor could I ever recover them. I have seen them at Gondar sold for
four ounces of gold, equal to ten pounds sterling, the pair.

On the 17th of February came messengers from Fasil, with the old
language of proposals of submission and peace, and a repetition of
his demand, that Welleta Selassé should be given him for a wife, and
sent to him, at least as far as Dingleber, where he would advance to
meet her; excusing himself from coming to Gondar, because the Ras
had already broken his promise to him; for the condition of peace
made with the Ras, when he was besieging the mountain, was, That if
Michael should bring the king to the Tacazzé, and surrender him there,
and then return and content himself with the government of Tigrè,
without proceeding to Gondar, that Fasil should receive the king and
conduct him to the capital, and be created Ras and governor in place
of Michael. Fasil had punctually performed his part, and of this
Michael had taken advantage, and had violated every article which he
had stipulated on the other side; and this was at least the alledged
reason why Fasil had refused to come to Gondar. The same evening
arrived also messengers from Gusho and Powussen, declaring to Ras
Michael, that, if he did not leave Gondar and return to Tigrè, they
would come and burn the town. They professed great duty to the king,
but charged the Ras with every sort of enormity, and upon his refusal
sent him a defiance.

The same evening came an express from Shoa, which most punctually
brought the book I so much wished for, containing the lives of the
first kings that lived at Shoa; a fair and fine copy, wrote upon
parchment in a large quarto size, in the pure ancient language of
Geez. The author was nearly contemporary with the annals which he
writes. I shewed it to the king, who till then had never seen it, and
who only said, I fear, Yagoube, you are carrying home these books only
to make your kings laugh at ours. The satisfaction I received upon the
acquisition of this book was greatly diminished by the loss of the
donor, Amha Yasous, who set out the 20th of February, attended with
about a hundred men, his own servants, and followed by the regret and
the good wishes of all that had known him, mine in particular, having
been, from the first time I saw him, very much attached to him.

Before his departure he had two long conferences with the king upon
the contents of the dispatches sent by his father from Shoa. The
substance he frankly told me was, that he did not intend to meddle
with the quarrels of Ras Michael, nor those of Fasil; that they
should settle these in their own way; but if either attempted any
thing against the king, set up any usurpers, as they had done in the
person of Socinios, and continued so far against their allegiance to
Tecla Haimanout as to withhold his whole revenue, and not to pay him
wherewithal to support his state, that he would consider himself as
protector of the royal family of Solomon, as the governors of Shoa
had always been.--It was believed very generally, by Amha Yasous
coming in person, that a treaty between some of the great men in both
sides, begun at his instance, would bring every man that could mount
a horse from as far south as Gingiro, to over-run both the provinces
of Begemder and Amhara, and either displace the two governors, or
at least force them to their duty; and it was owing to this, in all
probability, that Gusho acted with such moderation as he did in the
campaign that soon followed.




                               CHAP. V.

   _Rebel Army approaches Gondar--King marches out of Gondar--Takes
   Post at Serbraxos--The Author returns to Gondar with Confu
   wounded._


Gentle showers of rain began now to fall, and to announce the approach
of winter; nay, some unusually severe and copious had already fallen.
Gusho and Powussen of Amhara and Begemder, Kasmati Ayabdar governor
of Foggora, Aylo son of Ozoro Welleta Israel the queen's daughter,
governor of Gojam, Woodage Asahel, with the troops of Maitsha, and
Coque Abou Barea from Kuara, were at the head of all the forces they
could raise about Emfras and Nabca, and the borders of the lake Tzana.
A brother-in-law of Powussen had brought a considerable body of troops
from Zaat and Dehannah, two clans of Lasta, enemies to Guigarr, who
had declared for Michael; and these were the best horse in the rebel
army, superior to any in Begemder.

This numerous army of Confederates were all ready, expecting the rain
would make the Tacazzé impassable, and cut off Michael's retreat to
Tigrè. Fasil alone kept them in suspense, who, with about 12,000 men,
remained at Ibaba, professing to be at peace with Michael, in the mean
time keeping all Maitsha quiet, and waiting for the coming of Welleta
Yasous, and 20,000 Galla, whom he had sent for from the other side
of the Nile, intending, as he said, to march on the arrival of this
reinforcement, and join the king at Gondar. Although it may well be
doubted if ever he intended all or any part of this, one thing was
very certain, that he was sincere in his hatred to Gusho and Powussen;
he never could forget their treachery in breaking their appointment
and promise at Court-Ohha, and exposing him either to fight Michael
singly, or have his whole country burnt and destroyed. Although
Michael had, for these last months, done every thing in his power to
bring back to the king such people of consideration that possessed
the lands and estates about Gondar, and were the most respectable of
their nobility for influence and riches, bred up about court, and who
did chiefly constitute it; yet the cruelty of his executions, his
insatiable greed of money and power, and the extreme facility with
which he broke his most sacred engagements, had terrified them from
putting themselves into his hand; though they did not raise men, or
join any side, but lived privately at a distance, yet their absence
from about the king had the very worst effect upon his affairs. A
great desertion had likewise happened since his coming among his old
troops of Tigrè, both of officers and soldiers. The execution of
Guebra Denghel, and other two noblemen, had greatly alienated the
minds of many of their countrymen and their connections; but, above
all, his breach of promise made before the mountain of Haramat, that
he was to levy no taxes upon that province for seven years, (but which
he was now doing with the greatest rigour before one had expired)
discontented them all.

The return of Welleta Michael and Kefla Yasous from Samen, with about
6000 men, had considerably strengthened his army; added to this,
2000 more, who came voluntarily, from their love to Kefla Yasous,
from Temben, where he was governor; these were picked men, partly
musqueteers; there was nothing equal to them in the army.

Gusho was advanced to Minziro. Powussen had his head-quarters at
Korreva, not above sixteen miles from Gondar. The whole plain to the
lake was covered with troops. The weather was unseasonably cold, and
considerable quantities of rain had fallen from the 23d of February
to the 29th of March. The rebels had begun to lay waste Dembea, and
burnt all the villages in the plain from south to west, making it like
a desert between Michael and Fasil, as far as they dared venture to
advance towards either. This they did to exasperate Michael, and draw
him out from Gondar; for they had most of them great property in the
town, and did not wish to be obliged to fight him there. He bore this
fight very impatiently, as well as the constant complaints of people
flying into the town from the depredations of the enemy, and stripped
of every thing.

The king often ascended to the top of the tower of his palace, the
only one to which there remains a stair, and there contemplated,
with the greatest displeasure, the burning of his rich villages in
Dembea. One day while he was here he shewed an instance of that quick
penetration for which he was remarkable, and which, as a proof of
this, I shall here mention.

There is a large waste space on each side of the palace where the
market is kept. It had rained, and it was in the evening almost
destitute of people; there were only two men at a considerable
distance, who seemed to be in close conversation together, one of
them apparently very much the worse of liquor, the other had hold
of the end of the sash, or girdle, which was round the body of the
drunk man; it is a narrow web of cotton cloth, which they wind eight
or ten times about their waist. The king said to me, Do you know,
Yagoube, what these two men are about? I answered, No. I saw the
drunkard untwine one turn of his sash, which the other was feeling
and looking curiously at, as if examining and doubting its goodness.
That man, says the king, is robbing the drunkard of his sash: go
down two or three of you who run best, and apprehend him, but hide
yourselves till he has committed the theft, and seize him as he
passes. The orders were quickly obeyed; the drunkard unwound his
sash, by turning himself round and round, while the other seemed
to be measuring it by the length of his arm, from his elbow to his
forefinger, and then gathering it up. This was done very deliberately
till it was all unwound, and the far end loose; upon which the fellow,
who was measuring, gathering it in his arms, ran off as fast as he
could, leaving the drunkard standing motionless, apparently in great
surprise and amazement. The thief was immediately seized and brought
up to the king, who ordered him to be thrown over the tower. At my
intercession, and that of those about him, he was pardoned, and the
drunkard's sash was returned to him.

Ever since the middle of February, Ras Michael had resolved to march
out, and give battle to the rebels encamped about Korreva, committing
every sort of violence, and burning all the villages, houses, and
barns in Dembea, with the corn they contained more than what served
for their present use; but the great superiority of the enemy in horse
had always made him delay his intention.

Yasine had, indeed, succeeded in his commission to Sennaar, as far as
it regarded the horses. He had found the Arabs encamped immediately
upon the frontier at Ras el Feel, and had received from them very
near 200 of one kind or other, of which 76 only answered the purpose
of mounting the king's black servants; the others were distributed
among the rest of the army that wanted them. But they had not been
equally successful in purchasing their coats of mail, fourteen only of
which had been brought with the horses. In order to buy the rest, the
messenger continued his journey to Sennaar, and with him my servant
Soliman with my letters, to which, of consequence, I had as yet no
return. But what appeared at that time most material to me, Fidele
Shekh of Atbara wrote to Yasine, "That, there was no fear but that
I should be well received at Sennaar, where Nasser, a young king,
had succeeded his father, whom he had deposed; but that the great
difficulty was to pass between Ras el Feel and Teawa, the place of his
residence, and from thence to the banks of the river Dendera, for that
the Ganjar horse of Kuara, and the Arabs their friends, were at war
with the Arabs of Atbara, and had burnt all their crops and villages:
that he sometimes did not think himself safe in Teawa, and that a
load of salt had not been suffered to pass for several months; which,
indeed, was the reason why the Arabs of Atbara were come so near Ras
el Feel, and that the king's horse were procured so readily at the
first coming." This traitor, however, added, "That if, by any means, I
could advance to him at Teawa, I need not take any thought about the
rest of the journey; and that it was better I should come quietly and
quickly, without writing to Sennaar before-hand: and he concluded with
great professions of respect and friendship for me."

It had been very cold, and more than usual rainy, since the beginning
of February; the 9th was a day of close rain; and this, being earlier
than common, very much discouraged the soldiers who were naked, and,
therefore, very sensible of cold, or rain, and, as I have before said,
never can be brought to engage willingly, unless under the influence
of a warm sun.

At last the cries of the people flying into Gondar, seeking protection
from the cruelties of the rebels, determined the Ras to march out, and
set his all upon the fortune of a battle. The risk was not thought
great, as he had been all his life in use to conquer; had a better
army at that time than ever he commanded; the Begemder troops, too,
in whom the rebels trusted most, were but those which he and his men
had beaten at Nefas Musa, although led by a very brave and valiant
officer, Mariam Barea. All this was true; but then, since that period,
these troops of Begemder had been constantly led by himself, had been
trained, and disciplined with the old troops of Tigrè, and taught to
conquer with them. Above all, they had been used to see the effect of
fire-arms, which they no longer feared as formerly, but boldly rushed
in upon the musqueteers, sometimes without giving them time to fire,
or at least before they had time to charge again.

At last, having previously called in all his out-posts, on the 13th
of May he marched out of Gondar, taking with him the King and Abuna,
as also Ozoro Esther, and Ozoro Altash her sister, and all the other
ladies about court, who were in possession of the great fiefs of the
crown, and whom he obliged to personal attendance, as well as to bring
the quota of troops they were bound to by their respective tenures.

The king's army halted upon the same ground they had done on their
return to Gondar. They were then supposed to be near 20,000 foot,
belonging to Tigrè and its dependencies, incomparably the best troops
of the empire, 6000 of which were armed with musquets, six times the
number that all the rest of Abyssinia could furnish, and, considering
they were all match-locks, very expert in the management of them. The
rest of the foot which joined them since he passed the Tacazzè were
about 10,000, besides 2000 of the king's household, 500 of which were
horsemen; of these, few short of 200 were his black servants, armed
with coats of mail, the horses with plates of brass on their cheeks
and faces, with a sharp iron spike of about five inches in length,
which stuck out in the middle of their forehead, a very troublesome,
useless piece of their armour; their bridles were iron chains; the
body of the horse covered with a kind of thin quilt stuffed with
cotton, with two openings made above the flaps of the saddle, into
which the horseman put his thighs and legs, and which covered him from
his hip (where his shirt of mail ended) down to a little above his
ancle: his feet were covered with slippers of thin leather, without
heels, and his stirrups were of the Turkish or Moorish form, into
which his whole foot entered, and, being hung very short, he could
raise himself, and stand as firmly as if he was upon plain ground. The
saddles were in the Moorish form likewise, high before and behind;
a strong lace made fast to the coat of mail by the one end, the
other passed through a small hole in the back of the saddle, kept it
close down, so that the back was never exposed by the coat of mail
rising over the hinder part of the saddle. Each had a small ax in the
surcingle of his saddle, and a pike about fourteen feet long, the
weapon with which he charged; it was made of very light wood, brought
from the banks of the Nile, with a small four-edged head, and the butt
end balanced by a long spike of iron; this entered a leather case
fastened by a thong to the saddle, and was rested sometimes below the
thigh, and sometimes above, and guided by the right hand at the height
the point was intended to strike at. The horseman's head was covered
with a helmet of copper, or block tin, much like those of our light
horse, with large crests of black horse tail.

The officers were distinguished from the soldiers by locks of hair
dyed yellow, interspersed with the black. Upon the front of each
helmet was a silver star, at least a white-metal one, and before the
face, down to the top of the nose, a flap of iron chain, made in the
same manner as the coat of mail, but only lighter, which served as a
vizier. This was the most troublesome part of the whole, it was hot
and heavy, and constantly fretted the cheek and nose, when either the
man or the horse were in motion; and therefore I always substituted a
black silk net, which concealed my colour better, and for the rest of
my face I committed it to the care of Providence.

This body of horse was able to make their way through all the cavalry
in Abyssinia, if they had been drawn up against them with equal
fronts; for every horseman sat immoveable upon his saddle, and acted
most powerfully by his weight alone, and was perfectly master of his
person also by the breadth and shortness of his stirrups; whereas the
Abyssinian horsemen were placed most disadvantageously, their head
and body naked, their saddle small, and of no support to them, their
stirrup-leathers long, and no stirrups to put their foot in; but being
constantly afraid of their horse falling upon them, the only hold
which they had was the outside of an iron ring, which they grasped
between their great and second toe, so that they had no strength from
their stirrups, whilst their foot was always swelled, and their toes
sore and galled.

Of the thousand Shoa horse about 60 had deserted; the rest were all
in good order, each armed with their lances about ten feet long, and
two light javelins, their shafts being of cane, which they threw at a
great distance; the lance they never loosed out of their hand; as for
their stirrups and saddle, they were of the same bad construction as
those of the Abyssinians in general, and this reduced them nearly to a
footing with them.

The horsemen of the king's army were about 7000, mostly very
indifferent troops; so that his whole muster was nearly 7000
musqueteers, 25,000 foot, armed with lances and shields, and about
7500 horsemen; in round numbers about 40,000 men. It is not possible,
I believe, to know, with greater precision, the number, such is
the confusion of barbarous armies on these occasions, and such the
inclination of their leaders to magnify and increase their quotas.
Besides these, Ayto Confu and Sanuda were left with about 600 men
each, to protect Gondar from flying, pillaging parties, and to keep
the communication open between the army and the capital, from whence
the provisions were to be supplied.

This army was furnished with a number of excellent officers, veterans
of noble families, who had spent their whole life in war, which we
may say, for these last 400 years, has never ceased to lay desolate
this unhappy country; the principal were Ras Michael, who, arrived at
the age of seventy-four, had passed the last 50 years of his life in
a course of continued victories, Atsham Georgis, and Guebra Christos,
uncles by the mother's side to the king; Kefla Yasous, in the full
vigour of life, who, though unhappily born in a country plunged in
ignorance, and where there is no education, possessed every quality
that became a man, whether a soldier, statesman, citizen, or friend;
Welleta Michael, master of the household to the king; Billetana Gueta
Tecla; Basha Hezekias, and Guebra Mascal, two principal officers of
his musquetry, and a great number of others of equal merit, known
better in the camp than at the court; Aylo, and Engedan, two sons
of Kasmati Eshté; Ayto Confu, son of Ozoro Esther, all young men,
employed generally in enterprises, and growing every day more and
more into reputation.

It is impossible so much as to guess at the number of the enemy, they
were always very numerous, but constantly changing. It was said, that
Begemder and Lasta had at one time 30,000 horsemen; I should believe
this number greatly exaggerated, from what I heard afterwards; and
that the whole cavalry in their army did not exceed what it was at
the battle of Serbraxos. I suppose indeed, that, together with their
foot, they did not much exceed that number, tho' they were at times
magnified to 50 and 60,000, most of them very bad troops, continually
deserting, excepting about 4000 men belonging to Gusho, from Amhara,
who likewise brought about 100 match-locks, and besides these there
were scarcely any in the rebel army. I must not, however, forget 200
horsemen, Edjow Galla, servants and relations of the late king Joas,
who behaved in the most gallant and undaunted manner, and upon all
occasions set a noble example to the rest of the army.

Ras Michael himself led the van; the king the center, with Guebra
Mascal, and a considerable body of musqueteers of Tigrè; he had
no horse but those of his own household. The rear was commanded
by Welleta Michael, and Tecla: how disposed, or of what troops
constituted I know not, for the front, center, and rear were
understood to march in order, but it was often impossible to discern
any such divisions; we were often all in confusion, sometimes we were
in the middle of the front, sometimes joined and mixed with the rear;
all our officers had left their command, and were crowding about.
Ras Michael and the king; women bearing provisions, horns of liquor,
and mills for grinding corn, upon their backs; idle women of all
sorts, half dead with fear, crying and roaring, mounted upon mules;
and men driving mules loaded with baggage, mingled with the troops,
and passing through in all directions, presented such a tumultuous
appearance that it surpassed all description. There were above 10,000
women accompanying the army: the Ras had about 50 loaded with bouza,
and the king I suppose near as many.

The sight threw me for a moment into low spirits. I know not if the
king saw it. I was perfectly silent, when he cried, Well, what do you
say to us now, Yagoube? I answered, Is this the order in which your
majesty means to engage? He laughed, and said, Aye; why not, you will
see. If that is so, I replied, I only hope it is the enemy's custom as
well as your majesty's to be in no better order. The king was going
to answer me, when Guebra Mascal, who was just beside him, cried out,
This is a business you know nothing about, Yagoube; go to your Felac
(quadrant) and your fortune-telling, if you are afraid; we have no
need of you, nor your advice to-day. Respect for the presence of the
king, which you seem to be void of, said I, hinders me from answering
you as I otherwise would have done; but be assured, in which ever army
they were to-day, they are not men like Guebra Mascal whom I should
be afraid of. The king looked at him much displeased, and, I believe,
said something favourable of me; what it was I did not distinctly hear.

It was now about 10 o'clock, when, marching close along the foot of
the hills, we arrived at Tedda. The burying-place of Hatzé Hannes
I. son of Facilidas, and father of Yasous the Great, was scarce a
quarter of a mile to the S. W. of us, and the church of St George
a little more on the east, when orders came from the Ras for us to
encamp on the side of the hill, which we accordingly did, and were
presently in better order than we were when marching. The Ras, who
had passed the river of Tedda, encamped on the south side of it. It
happened that our two bodies, the front and center, were at that time
treading upon one another's heels; but the rear, from some accident,
was considerably behind, and part of it had scarce passed the Mogetch.

Both the burying-place, and church near it, were planted thick round
with Cyprus and cedar trees. Just a little before the Ras ordered us
to encamp, a messenger arrived from Netcho, (the Fit-Auraris) that
he had that morning met the Fit-Auraris of Begemder on this side of
the river Mariam; that he had killed the Fit-Auraris himself, (a man
of Lasta) with 37 of his men, and driven them back: he added, that
he intended to fall back himself upon the Ras's army, unless stopt
by contrary orders; these the Ras did not send, being desirous that
he should join him, as he soon after did, without being pursued: he
brought word that the army of the rebels was near at hand, between
Korreva and the lake; that Powussen's head-quarters were at Korreva,
and that he had heard Gusho had pushed on advanced posts, as far as
the church of Mariam; but this he did not know for certain, being
only the information of a dying man. Ras Michael immediately detached
Guebra Mascal, and another officer, with 400 men to take possession of
the sepulchre and the church at Tedda, and conceal themselves among
the cedar-trees.

We had not encamped long, before the rear came in sight. Confu, son
of Ozoro Esther, whom the Ras had left to guard Gondar, hearing how
near the enemy was, and the probability of a battle that day, had left
his post, and joined Yasine, with the horse of Ras el Feel, that were
in the rear; soon after this junction, Asahel Woodage, with about
400 men, partly Edjow Galla, (the late king Joas's household) partly
Maitsha, came up from the Dembea side of the lake Tzana, and began to
harrass the rear, marching in great confusion. Confu, though something
superior in number, was thought to be inferior in the goodness of
troops by much more than the difference; but the event proved the
contrary, for he charged Woodage Asahel so forcibly, that he obliged
him to quit our rear, and retire across the plain at a pace, which if
not a flight, did very much resemble it. Ayto Confu pressed vigorously
upon him, till, being now clear of the rest of the army, and in the
fair open plain, Woodage wheeled shortly about, and shewed by his
countenance that it was not to avoid Ayto Confu, but Ras Michael's
musquetry, that he retreated to a greater distance; both sides stopt
to breathe their horses for some minutes; but it was plain afterwards,
Asahel Woodage, an old soldier, trusted much to the known valour of
his troops, and wished to strike a blow of consequence in presence of
his old enemy the Ras.

Ras Michael was at the door of his tent then playing at dams, or
drafts, as was his custom, and Ozoro Esther was trembling to see her
son on the point of being surrounded by merciless Galla, the nation
who most of all she detested, and who had every cause to hate her. All
the young men, (Confu's friends) with their lances in their hands, and
ready to mount on horseback, beseeched the Ras to allow them to go
down into the plain to the assistance of Confu; but the old general,
without leaving off his game, said, "I do strictly forbid one of you
to stir; Confu has broke my orders to-day, and brought himself into a
scrape by his own folly; let me see him get out of it by his courage
and conduct, and thereby set the army a better example than he yet has
done."--"Sir, said I, at least station some musquetry on the small
hill, at the edge of the plain, that, if Confu is beaten, I may not
have the mortification of seeing Yasine, and the new troops of Ras
el Feel, (who were in their proper post) and have all my baggage and
provisions, massacred before my eyes by these cowardly barbarians."
I spoke this in the utmost anguish, when the Ras lifted up his head
with, a ghastly kind of laugh, and said, "Right, well do so, Yagoube."
Though this was but an imperfect permission, I ran down to the station
with such haste that I fell twice in my way, and was considerably
hurt, for the ground was rocky, and the grass slippery.

Although I had only waved my cloak, and cried come on sirs, a large
number of match-locks of Ozoro Esther's, and the king's, hastened
immediately to the ground. Confu by this time had charged, and
after a stout resistance beat Woodage back into the plain; Woodage,
however, again faced about, and after some resistance, Confu in his
turn was driven back in evident disorder, and pushed almost in upon
the post, where our soldiers had made ready their musquets, to fire
if they came a step nearer. At this instant a body of about 30 or 40
horse (the commander we afterwards knew to be Ayto Engedan) came up
full gallop from the right, and stopt the Galla in their pursuit.
Confu's men rallied upon this assistance, and Asahel Woodage retired
in a direction passing close under the sepulchre, Engedan and Confu
keeping at a moderate pace on his left between them and the army, and
forcing them down, as it were, to the trap they knew was laid for
them. They were yet a long shot from the cedars that surrounded the
sepulchre, when a volley was discharged at them from among the trees,
where Michael had posted his 400 men, which, though it did little or
no execution, terrified Woodage Asahel's men so much, that Confu and
Engedan, charging in that instant as upon a signal, they all dispersed
through different parts of the field, and their leader after them:
Joas's Edjow, indeed, would not fall back a step upon the volley, but,
after an obstinate resistance, they were broken by superior numbers,
and forced to retreat before an enemy, so overcome with fatigue and
wounds, as to be unable to pursue them.

The whole of this engagement lasted near an hour by my watch. One
hundred and thirteen of Woodage Asahel's men were slain upon the spot,
and their bloody trophies brought and thrown before the king. On
Confu's side about 70 were killed and wounded; he himself received two
wounds, one a large flesh wound in the hip, the other more slight upon
the head, both of them at the very beginning of the engagement.

Notwithstanding the natural hardness of his heart, and that the
misfortune which had happened was in immediate disobedience of orders,
Ras Michael shewed great sensibility at hearing Confu was wounded; he
came immediately to see him, a visit not according to etiquette, and
gave him a slighter reproof than was expected for leaving his post in
the town, as well as for his fighting without his orders. Confu, with
great submission and address at the same time, excused his leaving his
post, from the repeated information he had received that a decisive
battle was to be fought that day, and knowing the Ras's want of horse,
he could not stay at Gondar, and keep his idle, when the fate of so
kind a father, (as the Ras had been) and that of a mother, to whom he
owed every thing, was depending. He said it would be more agreeable
to him to die by the hands of the executioner of the camp, as an
example for disobedience of orders, than survive with the reflection
that he had been voluntarily absent from such an occasion. As for
engaging with Asahel Woodage that day, he said he had no intention of
that kind; that he knew not who he was when he attacked him, and only
endeavoured to hinder him from harrassing the rear of the army, and
destroying the provisions: That when he charged him first, Woodage was
among the women, loaded with bouza, flour, and spirits, which were
coming to the Ras, and great part of which he had intercepted, as the
Ras would find. Michael could not help laughing at this last part of
the excuse, but went away, and, in his conversation that evening,
gave Confu the highest praises for his conduct and bravery, but said
nothing of his fault.

Engedan was next arraigned for fighting without orders. He, too,
answered with great humility, That when he saw the infantry run down
the hill, with their matches lighted, he thought it was the Ras's
intention to relieve Confu by the most effectual means possible; but
at any rate he could never, with arms in his hands, stand looking on,
while his cousin-german and companion was massacred by Galla. All
ended well. The truth is, Michael never would find fault with a man
that fought, however imprudently he fought the occasion: courage was
to him in place of charity; it covered a multitude of sins.

Ozoro Esther, in the deepest concern, had attended her son from the
moment of his arrival, and had seen his wound dressed and swathed up.
A large gaping flesh-wound (such as his was) frightens ignorant people
more than the small orifice made by a shot, which breaks bones and
endangers life. Such was Ozoro Esther's apprehension; and every minute
she inquired of me if I thought it was possible he could recover. I
had not quitted him since he had got off his horse. I advised him by
all means to go in a litter to Gondar, either carried by men or mules;
but no persuasion, nor consideration, would induce him to go otherwise
than on a mule, with his horse harnessed and led by him.

Every thing was accordingly prepared, when I received a message from
the Ras to wait upon him. I immediately went to his tent, and found
him with two dwarf boys only, who were fanning the flies from his
face. "Ozoro Esther wishes, says he, that you would see Confu safe to
Gondar, and bring us word to-morrow how he is; and you must stay with
him altogether, if he is in danger."--"If he has no fever, said I, he
is in no danger. If the king and you"--He then interrupted me,--"The
king, and I, and every one, wishes you to attend Confu." I bowed, and
went away without reply. When I was got to the door he cried after
me, "Don't be afraid, you will be in time enough to see every thing;
neither they nor I wish an engagement but at Serbraxos."

I did not understand the meaning of the speech, but went away without
reply straight to the king's tent; and I was just going to speak when
he stopt me, by crying, "Go, go, for God's sake! Ozoro Esther has been
here almost out of her senses." I went on this to her tent, where I
found her sitting by Confu and drowned in tears, which at times were
interrupted by fits of seeming distraction. He began to feel the loss
of blood, which would have made me wish not to move him; but there was
no staying here for sick people; and so violent a spirit had spread
through the army, upon Netcho's success and Confu's victory, that
one and all insisted upon fighting the next day; and several of my
friends, who knew where I was going, shook hands with me at my passing
them, saying, "Farewell, Yagoube; we are sorry to lose you, but all
will be over before you come back."

I now insisted more than ever upon Confu's going in a litter, and
setting out immediately, which was accordingly complied with. Ozoro
Esther had dinner, or rather supper, ready in a moment, and I had
great need of it, having scarcely tasted any thing for two days.
While I was eating, Ozoro Esther could not stop the effusions of her
gratitude for the care I had again taken of Confu. "I knew, says she,
you would have refused me, if I had endeavoured to persuade you to go
away from the camp, when there are such fair expectations, you may be
knocked on the head to-morrow; and therefore I applied to the Ras by
force to bend that rash, proud spirit of yours, which one day will be
the occasion of your death."--"Madam, said I, you do me injustice if
you will not believe that I had rather obey your commands than those
of any general upon earth: But, pray, what is the meaning of the Ras's
speech to me about both armies wishing to fight at Serbraxos[9]?
Where is this Serbraxos?"--"Why, says she, here, on a hill just by;
the Begemder people have a prophecy, that one of their governors is
to fight a king at Serbraxos, to defeat him, and slay him there: in
his place is to succeed another king, whose name is Theodorus, and in
whose reign all Abyssinia is to be free from war, or from any trouble,
sickness, or famine; that the Galla, Shangalla, and Mahometans are
all to be destroyed, and the empire of Abyssinia to be extended
as far as Jerusalem."--"All this destruction and conquest without
war! That will be curious indeed. I think I could wish to see this
Theodorus," said I, laughing. "See him you will, replied Ozoro Esther;
peace, happiness, and plenty will last all his reign, and a thousand
years afterwards. Enoch and Elias will rise again, and will fight
and destroy Gog and Magog, and all this without any war."--"On which
I again said, that must be cleverly managed. And now, why does Ras
Michael choose to fight at Serbraxos? I do not think he is desirous
to pay his court to the king Theodorus, or any king brought him by
Begemder."--"Why, says she, all the hermits and holy men on our side,
that can prophecy, have assured him he is to beat the rebels this
month at Serbraxos; and a very holy man, a hermit from Waldubba, came
to him at Gondar, and obliged him to march out against his will, by
telling him this prophecy, which he knows to be true, as the man is
not like common prophets, but one who never ate any thing but roots,
or drank other liquor than water, since the day of his nativity. Such
a man as this, you know, Yagoube, cannot lie." "And I, says Ayto
Confu, being a prophet that hath ate beef and drunk bouza ever since
my nativity, whenever I could not get wine or brandy, and who give my
share of water freely to the saints of Waldubba, as a proper reward
for the lies they tell, I do prophecy, that there are now two thousand
men eating their supper within sight of Serbraxos, who will never see
it nearer, but will all be slain in a battle fought at this place
to-morrow, at which time Yagoube shall be feasting with me at Gondar,
without caring a fig for king Theodorus and his plenty."--"A blessed
prophet you!" says Ozoro Esther.

At this instant the servants at the door informed us there was scarce
light to see the way down the hill, and we got our wounded prophet,
without much difficulty or complaint, into the litter. A number of men
supported him down the hill, and about 50 of his own horse attended. I
desired him to feel often the bandage if his wound bled; and, finding
it did not, I rode on horseback close by his side. For some time, not
hearing him stir or speak, I thought he was asleep, or had fainted;
on which I stopt the litter, felt his pulse, and asked him if he was
dosing? He said, No; he was thinking of all the lies his mother had
been telling me: but there is one thing she did not care to tell you,
Yagoube, she says you laugh at these stories; but there is a spirit
who always appears to Michael and assures him of victory. The devil,
said I, probably; for what good arises from all these victories? are
they not the ruin of innocent people, and of the country? No, replied
Confu, it is St Michael the archangel; he saw him just before he
surprised the mountain Haramat, but neither at Gondar, nor since he
passed the Tacazzé, and this makes him sorrowful. The spirit has
been afraid to catch cold, said I, by wetting his feet in that cold
river. I doubt so, answered Confu; but the liar of a monk, who my
mother supposes never eats nor drinks, told him he was to see him at
Serbraxos.

At this time we heard the noise of horses, and could discern (as we
thought) three men that passed the bridge of Mogetch briskly before
us. As they seemed to avoid us, six or eight of Confu's men pursued
them at full gallop, but lost them in the darkness. They, however,
were found to be soldiers of Kasmati Sanuda, who hearing Woodage
Asahel had been engaged with Ayto Confu, had come out with the
unworthy purpose of collecting some filthy trophies, by mangling the
dead or wounded, though these must have been their own companions, the
soldiers of Ayto Confu, who had been slain; for the whole of Woodage
Asahel's men had already undergone what Strates emphatically called
the _operation_, by the knives of Confu's soldiers. We now arrived
at Koscam without any adventure, and Confu was laid to repose, after
taking a little food: in obedience to the orders of Ozoro Esther, I
lay down by him in the same apartment.

Early next morning I was sent for by a servant of Ozoro Esther, to
attend Welleta Selassé, who I was told was at the point of death.
I repaired immediately to the house of Ras Michael, where she then
was, but found her without possibility of recovery, having already
lost her speech. She expired a few minutes afterwards, apparently in
violent agonies. The cause was never properly known; some attributed
it to the jealousy of Ozoro Esther, others alledged that she had taken
poison from apprehension of falling into the hands of Ras Michael:
whatever was the truth, her servants certainly told me, that she had
confessed she had taken poison, and not till the pain became violent,
and then she turned afraid, would she consent to have an express sent
to Ozoro Esther, to bring me from the camp. I had unluckily left it
before to attend Ayto Confu, neither is it probable I could have been
of any service, as the poison she had taken was arsenic. This accident
detained me that whole day, so that, instead of returning to the army,
I went to Ayto Confu at Koscam, where I found another messenger in
search of me.

The king's Mahometan was returned from Sennaar, and with him Soliman
my servant, who brought me answers to the letters I had written; they
had come by Beyla to Ras el Feel, by Sim Sim, and the western deserts,
the way to Teawa being much infested by gangs of Arabs, and Ganjar
horse, who murdered every body they found in their way. They brought
with them only twelve horses, eighteen coats of mail, and about thirty
libd[10]; these were mostly returns made by the principal members of
government to the presents the king had sent them, for every body at
Sennaar now set too great a value upon the armour, and horses, to part
easily with them, on account of the unsettled state of the times, the
history of which we shall give afterwards.

My letters informed me that the whole kingdom of Sennaar was in
arms, that Nasser (who had deposed his father by the help of two
great brothers, Mahomet Abou Calec, and Adelan) was upon the point
of trusting his life and kingdom to the event of a battle with these
two officers. I was, moreover, conjured, with all the earnestness, as
I thought, of a truly honest man, that I would by no means undertake
the journey I intended; that to come from Ras el Feel to Sennaar, was,
for a white man like me, next to an absolute impossibility, connecting
the danger of the way with the great hardships from the excessive
heat of the climate, and want of food and water; that even arrived at
Sennaar, I should be in the utmost danger from the soldiery, and the
king's slaves, under no subordination or government; and that, even
if I was happy enough to escape these, the worst still remained, and
no human power could convoy or protect me, in my remaining journey
to Egypt through the great desert. I was therefore begged to lay all
such intention aside as impossible, and either stay where I was, or
return by Tigrè, Masuah, and Arabia, the way by which I first entered
Abyssinia. This was the severest of all blows to me, and threw me
for some time into the lowest despondency, but it did not change my
resolution, which was already taken, not to turn to the right or the
left, but either compleat my journey to Syene, the frontier of Egypt,
by Sennaar, and Nubia, or perish in the attempt.

I now resolved to proceed immediately to the camp, taking twenty horse
from Sanuda, and twenty from Confu, to escort the coats of mail and
horses from Sennaar. I set out that evening with Mahomet the king's
servant, by the road of Sema Confu, and arrived about nine o'clock
in the camp, without any adventure, bringing the news of Welleta
Selassé's death, which seemed to cause neither surprise nor sorrow,
and was never after spoken of either by the Ras or Ozoro Esther; but
very great rejoicings were made at the good accounts of Ayto Confu,
with very kind expressions of me, both from the Ras and Ozoro Esther.

Before he went to bed, the king had examined Mahomet, and drawn from
him the true state of the kingdom of Sennaar; he then sent for me, and
ordered me to deliver him my letters, which I did, interpreting them
to him, word for word. He said, however, but little at this time, as
he thought that that door, being so effectually shut against me, less
could be urged against the safer, and more known road through Tigrè,
which, of course, it was presumed I should more eagerly embrace;
he kept my letters, and ordered me to choose two of the horses for
myself, which I did, one of them near seventeen hands high, I suppose
one of the most powerful horses in the world. The rest he distributed
among the black troops; the same he did with the coats of mail. I
found the army in great spirits, but still the story of fighting
only at Serbraxos seemed to be obstinately persisted in. I asked
Ozoro Esther if St Michael had yet appeared to the Ras; she answered,
"Hush! for God's sake, don't make a joke of this, one word of this
kind repeated to him would prevent your ever receiving a favour from
Michael."

It happened that, the day after I had attended Ayto Confu to Gondar,
Ras Michael sent some soldiers into Dembea to forage, these had been
intercepted by a party posted on purpose by Kasmati Ayabdar and Gusho,
consisting of Edjow Galla, with some horse from Foggora and Amhara.
An engagement happened pretty much in the same place and manner as
that with Woodage Asahel and Ayto Confu, in full view of the camp,
and assistance was sent on both sides to the respective parties. The
troops commanded by Aylo, brother of Engedan, and Guebra Mascal, were
beaten back almost close to the camp, by the horse led by the Edjow
Galla, though brave and veteran soldiers, while Ras Michael ordered
Yasine and his 200 from Ras el Feel, (all with their libds on) to
charge the Galla, now advanced very near. Each horse had a number of
brass bells at his neck, and they no sooner appeared than the whole
cavalry of the enemy, starting at the hideous figure and noise, fell
into confusion, and, being closely pressed with violent blows of their
great swords, no longer disputed the ground, but left the field on the
gallop. A beautiful grey horse of Gusho's, superbly ornamented with
gold and silver, and having a very rich broad-sword hanging at his
saddle, and a pole-ax on the other side under the surcingle, was taken
by some soldiers of Ras el Feel, who spread the report instantly that
Gusho was slain. Immediately on this, orders were given for the whole
army to descend into the plain, which they did with great alacrity,
forming in order of battle, though neither the king nor Ras Michael
left the camp, nor did any adversary appear; and the troops, content
with this bravado, returned again in great spirits to the camp.

This is the account I heard of that day's skirmish, for I was not
present there, being at Gondar with Ayto Confu. In the evening of that
very day arrived a messenger from Gusho, telling Ras Michael, that a
young boy, a nephew of his, had, without his knowledge, gone to see
the engagement, and had taken with him his favourite horse, who,
being frightened at the Arabs with their libds, had thrown him, after
which he had run off and left the horse among the enemy. He begged
to have his horse restored at any price, if the man that had taken
him was allowed to sell him. He at the same time sent a present of a
large quantity of fruit and fresh fish from the lake. The messenger
was a priest well known by Ras Michael, and warmly attached to the
king, and it was thought came with an errand of more consequence than
either about the horse or the fish. The Ras sent him for his answer
to the King, who told him, the horse being taken by the troops of Ras
el Feel, belonged to me, and with me he must make his bargain: that
I was at Gondar, and my return uncertain; but that the next day he
might have my answer. This was the better to conceal the priest's real
business, for the King and Ras knew how they were to dispose of the
horse; at least they certainly knew I was not to return him without
their orders.

The morning after my arrival this same priest came to me with a
message from Gusho, desiring I would send him his horse, as a proof
of the friendship which he said had always subsisted between us, at
the same time offering me any sum of money that I might have promised
to content the soldiers who took him. As I had before obtained leave
from Ras Michael to restore the horse, so I did it with the very best
grace possible, sending Yasine himself, chief of the troops of Ras el
Feel, with the message to Gusho, that I reckoned myself exceedingly
happy in having that opportunity of obliging him, and of shewing the
value I had ever set upon his friendship; that he very well knew the
little regard I had for money, and that the soldier who took the
horse was my servant, and had already been abundantly satisfied. I
desired Yasine to add, that I hoped, in order to a continuation of
that friendship, he would avoid, in his own particular command, or
in that of his relations, attacking where the king was in person,
because it was my indispensible duty to be there, and that his nephew
might not escape with the loss of a horse, if he again happened to be
engaged with the Moorish troops, who, though under my command, were
Mahometans, strangers to the language, and to whom it was impossible
for me to convey any distinction of persons. Gusho was exceedingly
sensible of this civil return of the horse; he cloathed Yasine
magnificently, made him a present of another horse, and sent a very
flattering message by him to me.

   _Michael attempts to enter Begemder--First Battle of
   Serbraxos--The Rebels offer Battle to the King in the
   Plain--Armies separated by a violent Storm._


Yasine had scarcely returned to the camp when all the tents were
struck, and the army on its march. The Ras and Guebra Mascal led the
van, the king and Guebra Christos the center, Kasmati Kefla Yasous the
rear; Netcho the Fit-Auraris being about half an hour's march before
us, we proceeded along the plain without interruption; Ayto Engedan,
with a small body of horse, was covering the king's right flank at
some distance. The church of Serbraxos was on our left upon the side
of a hill, and we expected to see the Fit-Auraris take up his ground
for encamping there, as it was the field of action determined upon by
both parties. The Fit-Auraris, however, first, and then Ras Michael
with the van, passed below Serbraxos at so brisk a pace that we in the
center found it difficult to keep up with them.

A long valley, having the mountains of Begemder on the south, or
farthest end, was what the Ras had now entered, and he flattered
himself, by a forced march, to arrive at those mountains. When once
in Begemder, he knew that he not only should occasion a revolt among
the troops of Powussen, (many of whom had followed him by force rather
than inclination) but likewise he was assured that he should be met
by many powerful noblemen and friends to the king, both of Lasta and
Begemder, whom Powussen dared not force to follow him, and who had
staid at home; by this means, he conceived his army would be so much
increased that he soon should bring the rebels to reason.

The river Mariam runs along the west side of this valley, shallow, but
brisk and clear, and the water excellent, while a small brook, called
Deg-Ohha, (that is, the water of honour, or of worth) falling from
the mountains on the east, runs close by the bottom of the hill of
Serbraxos, where it joins the Mariam. The center of the army was just
entering from the plain into the valley, and the king's horse passing
Deg-Ohha, when we heard a firing in the front, which we guessed to be
from the Fit-Auraris; soon after followed a repeated firing from the
van, engaged about a short two miles distance, though a long even hill
in the midst of the valley, and its windings, hindered us from seeing
them.

Guebra Christos immediately made his disposition; he placed his horse,
and foot in the intervals of the horse, in the middle of the valley;
his musquetry on the right and left, the former upon the skirts of
the hill already mentioned, to run along the valley; the latter up
the skirts of the hill of Serbraxos. Orders very soon arrived from
Ras Michael, which did not alter the disposition; and Kefla Yasous
with the rear arriving at the same time, just joined and doubled the
several posts as they had been taken; our position was to the utmost
of our wish; but it had not been so with Michael, for he no sooner
had got into the plain, where he had the hills no longer either on
his right or left, than he was attacked by Powussen, with the whole
force of Begemder, who cut off the troops of his Fit-Auraris to a
man, he, and two or three common soldiers, only escaping. This was
owing to Michael's retreating instead of supporting him; for he had
scarcely given time for Powussen to come up with his horse, who fought
more desperately than was their usual custom, than he himself again
took possession of the entrance of the valley, and lined the hill on
both sides with fire-arms. A very general and sharp fire from Guebra
Mascal, and the musquetry, (who had occupied the south end of the long
hill) soon obliged Powussen to leave Michael's cavalry, which he would
else have inevitably destroyed, and shelter himself in the plain from
the violent effect of the shot, which rained upon him alternately from
the hills on each side of the valley.

At this time we were in the greatest anxiety, from the report of the
musquets always coming nearer us, though, by the contrary winds, the
smoke was carried from us. The day was far advanced, and excessively
hot: the foot soldiers were busy in giving our horses drink out of
our own helmets, which they filled from Deg-Ohha. All the troops
were impatient, however, to come to an action upon that ground. At
this time an officer from Michael came to Kefla Yasous, who was
on horseback near the king, ordering him to send a body of fresh
horse to support the cavalry of his division, with an intention,
if possible, to bring on a general engagement. In the mean time he
ordered Kefla Yasous to keep firm, as he then was, in the post of
Serbraxos, and not to advance till he was sure that Gusho and Ayabdar
had left their ground, joined Powussen, and were engaged with him
at the south end of the valley. These instructions were perfectly
understood by that sagacious and veteran general. He detached 500
Shoa, with near the same number of horse belonging to Engedan, and
commanded by him, and these, joined to the cavalry already in the van,
again attempting to pass the plain, were attacked by Powussen and the
troops of Begemder, who had been likewise reinforced, and after an
obstinate engagement they had retired into the mouth of the valley,
not from being actually beaten, but by direction of Ras Michael,
in order to bring the enemy pursuing them under the fire of the
musquetry, on each side of the entrance of the valley.

I was exceedingly curious to have seen this engagement, and I begged
Kefla Yasous to speak to the king to permit me to go singly with
Engedan. To this, however, I had a flat refusal, not without some
marks of peevishness and displeasure, which Kefla Yasous qualified
by saying, "Don't be dismayed, you shall see;" and in that instant
the word was given to march to the right, whilst the troops left the
valley between the long hill and the mountains, and took post on the
side of the river Mariam, with their faces fronting the west. The
musquetry was placed upon the eminences to the north and south, as
if to defend the ford of the river, thro' which the entrance was, to
the north end of the valley. Michael, in the mean time, had, by the
feigned retreat of his cavalry, decoyed the Begemder troops within
reach of the musquetry, and they were again put in disorder by the
discharge on each side of the hill, without being able to advance a
step further; after which he ordered some tents to be pitched upon the
hill on his right, as if intending to encamp there.

Kasmati Ayabdar, who commanded the left wing of the rebels, imagining
that the whole army had advanced to the south of the valley with Ras
Michael, thought this was an opportunity of surrounding the king's
troops, and cutting them off from their camp and strong post upon the
hill of Serbraxos; with this intention he advanced rapidly to the ford
of the river Mariam, thinking to take post on the hill which was to
our rear, being that of Serbraxos. When he advanced, however, near
that river, and saw the king and his cavalry drawn up on the banks
of it, his heart failed him, and he halted within a short quarter of
a mile of our troops. In order to decoy and make him more confident,
Kefla Yasous ordered the horse to retreat and cross the river as fast
as they could, with an appearance of confusion, that he might draw
their horse within reach of our musquetry planted upon every eminence.
The king shewed great reluctance at this manuvre, however wise.
He repeated very peevishly, What is this! What is this! Am I retiring
before rebels?--Neither did this stratagem succeed but in part, for
Ayabdar, either distrusting the trap laid for him, or afraid to enter
into an engagement with the king, advanced but a few paces, and again
halted, apparently not decided what he was to do.

The Edjow Galla alone advanced to the very brink of the river, and
when the musquetry began to be fired at them, which would probably
quickly have put them into confusion, the king, losing all patience,
ordered the black horse, and all the heavy-armed troops, to charge
them, which was instantly executed with the greatest speed; the Galla
were all borne down, with little or no resistance, by the length of
our pikes, and the superior weight of our horses, and those that were
not slain were scattered over the plain. But a greater misfortune
befel us from our friends than from our enemies, as a volley of shot
was poured upon us from Serbraxos hill, on the right hand, which
killed seven men, notwithstanding their coats of mail. The king
himself was in great danger, being in the middle of the engagement,
and unarmed; young prince George, who fought by his side, was shot in
the thumb of his left hand. Kefla Yasous, who saw the danger the king
was in, riding about, holding out his hand and crying not to fire, was
shot through the hair, the ball just grazing his head above the ear,
and another wounding his horse just above his thigh, but so slightly,
that it was afterwards extracted by a servant's fingers.

Ayabdar, after the loss of his Edjow Galla, retreated to the camp,
amidst the curses and imprecations of the army, who, not informed of
the king's strength, thought the war might have been ended by a proper
exertion and perseverance in his part that day. Gusho his nephew,
who had staid to guard the camp, but who had reinforced Powussen and
Ayabdar each of them with a part of his troops, spoke of his uncle in
the bitterest terms of reproach, continually calling him dotard and
coward, and declaring him incapable of command or service. Whether
this was really his opinion, or only said with a view of forwarding
a scheme already laid, I will not say; but certainly it was the
foundation of a quarrel which, by its consequences, did greatly weaken
the rebels, and contributed much afterwards to maintain the king
upon the throne; for Gusho, who, upon the defeat of Ras Michael, was
destined by all parties to take the lead, was as lavish in praises of
Powussen for his behaviour that day, as he was bitter in condemning
his uncle, which created a violent misunderstanding between these two
chiefs, insomuch that Asahel Woodage, with his troops of Maitsha, left
Ayabdar, and joined Powussen. Confu, moreover, son of Basha Eusebius,
and brother to Guebra Mehedin, who had frustrated my first attempt
to discover the source of the Nile, endeavouring to promote a revolt
among the troops of Foggora, to which he belonged, was put in irons by
Ayabdar, from which he was but too soon released to meet, a few days
afterwards, a fate that put an end to his profligacy and follies.

Powussen in this conflict had retreated, if not beaten, with a
considerable loss; nine hundred of his best troops were said to
have been slain that day, and a great many more wounded, most of
whom (those I mean that had gun-shot wounds) died from the want of
surgeons, and the ignorance of those who undertook to cure them.
On the part of Michael about 300 men, all of the cavalry, were
said to have perished that day, including the troops of Netcho the
Fit-Auraris. Of the king's division about twenty-three were killed,
seven of these being his guards, I believe mostly by the unfortunate
fire of his troops, arising from his own impatience in attacking the
Galla unadvisedly, of whom about sixty were left upon the field, all
slain in the attack, for they were not pursued, but joined their main
body immediately.

Ras Michael fell back upon the army, which had encamped on the hill
of Serbraxos; and it now was believed more than before, that the
fate of the empire was to be determined on that spot. Another thing,
however, appeared plain, that whatever belief Michael pretended in
the prophecy, he would not have preferred fighting at Serbraxos, if
he could by any means have given the rebels the slip, and marched his
army into Begemder. The king was exceedingly pleased at the part he
had taken that day; it was the first time he was engaged in person,
nor did any body venture to condemn it; he shewed, indeed, very little
concern at his brother's wound, which was only a slight one in the
fleshy part of his thumb, nor did the young prince trouble himself
much about it; on the contrary, when I went to dress and bind it up,
he said to me, I wish, Yagoube, the shot had carried the thumb off
altogether, it would have made me incapable of succeeding to the
throne, and they would not then send me to the hill of Wechné. The
king, upon hearing this, said with a smile, George forgets that Hatzé
Hannes, my father and his, was called to the throne many years after
his whole hand had been cut off. Every one agreed that Ras Michael had
that day shewn a degree of intrepidity and military skill superior to
any thing which had appeared in many former engagements in which he
had commanded. No sooner had he refreshed himself with a meal, than
he called a council of his officers, which lasted great part of the
evening, notwithstanding the fatigue he had undergone throughout the
day.

This was the first battle of Serbraxos, which, though it contained
nothing decisive, had still two very material consequences, as it so
daunted the spirits of the Begemder horse, that many chiefs of that
country withdrew their troops, and went home, whilst such discord was
sown among the leaders, that I believe they never sincerely trusted
one another afterwards; Gusho and Ayabdar, in particular, were known
to correspond with the king daily.

On the morrow after the battle, three messengers arrived from Gusho,
Powussen, and Ayabdar, and each had a separate audience of the King
and Ras, before whom they all three severally declared, that their
masters desired to continue in allegiance to him their king, Tecla
Haimanout, but under this condition only, that Ras Michael should
be sent to his government of Tigrè, never more to return. They
endeavoured to persuade the king also to take the sense of his army,
the majority of which, they asserted, were ready to abandon him. If
Michael should agree to return to Tigrè, they offered to carry the
king to Gondar, place him in his palace, and allow him to choose his
own ministers, and govern for the future after his own ideas. This,
indeed, was the universal wish, and I did not see what Ras Michael
could have done, had he adopted it; but fear, or gratitude, or both,
restrained the young king from such a measure; and the messengers left
him after a plain declaration, That they had endeavoured all in their
power to save him, and he must now abide the consequences, for they
washed their hands of them.

The rains were now become more frequent, and an epidemical fever had
shewn itself in the rebel army on the plain; every consideration,
therefore, seemed to persuade a speedy decision, but the consequences
of the last engagement seemed to have damped the spirit of the rebels,
without having much raised that of the king's army. In fact, the
days were dark and wet, and the nights cold, circumstances in which
no Abyssinian chooses to fight. The army was thinly cloathed, or not
cloathed at all, and encamped on high ground, where fuel, though it
had not failed them yet, must soon have done so.

An accident that happened this night had nearly brought about a
revolution which the wisest heads had laboured for many years in vain.
Ras Michael had retired to bed at his ordinary time, somewhat before
eleven o'clock, and a lamp was left burning as usual in his tent, for
he was afraid of _spirits_. He was just fallen asleep, when he felt
a man's arm reach into the bed over him, which he immediately seized
hold of, crying to his attendants, at the same time, for help. Those
that ran first into the tent threw down the lamp and put out the
light, so that the man would have escaped, had not the people behind
got about him, and endeavoured to hold him down, while entangled in,
and struggling with the cords of the tent. The first person that
seized him was a favourite servant of the Ras, a young man named Laeca
Mariam, of a good family in Tigrè; he, not perceiving his danger for
want of light, received a stab with a broad knife, which pierced his
heart, so that he fell without speaking a word. Numbers immediately
secured the assassin, who was found to have dropt one knife within the
Ras's tent, with which he had attempted at first to have stabbed him:
but he was found to have another knife, two-edged, and sharp in the
point, fixed along his arm, with which he had stabbed Laeca Mariam.
This wretch was a native of a very barbarous nation near Shoa, S. E.
of Gojam. The name of their country is Guragué. They are Troglodytes,
and all robbers: their constant occupation is attending the Abyssinian
camps, and stealing horses, mules, or whatever they can get, which
they do in a very singular manner.

They all wear their hair very short, strip themselves stark-naked,
and besmear themselves from head to foot with butter, or some sort
of grease, whilst, along the outside of their arm, they tye a long,
straight, two-edged, sharp-pointed knife, the handle reaching into the
palm of their hand, and about four inches of the blade above the knob
of their elbow, so that the whole blade is safe and inoffensive when
the arm is extended, but when it is bent, about four inches projects,
and is bare beyond the elbow joint; this being all prepared, they
take a leafy faggot, such as the gatherers of fuel bring to the camp,
which they fasten to their middle by a string or withy, spreading it
over to conceal or cover all their back, and then drawing in their
legs, they lie down, in all appearance, as a faggot, and in the part
of the camp they intend to rob, crawling slowly in the dark when they
think they are unperceived, and lying still when there is any noise
or movement near them: In case they find themselves discovered, they
slip the faggot and run; and whatever part of them you seize escapes
your fingers by reason of the grease. If you endeavour to clasp them,
however, which is the only way left, the Guragué bends his elbow and
strikes you with his knife, and you are mortally wounded, as was the
case with Laeca Mariam.

This assassin was no sooner secured and disarmed, than a noose, with
a running knot, was slipt round his neck, and his hands tied behind
his back, in which manner he was carried before Ras Michael, who sat
upon a stool at some distance from his tent, after every part of it
had been searched. The fellow at first refused to speak, but, being
threatened with torture, answered, in his own language, which I did
not understand. He was asked, who had employed him to attempt that
assassination? He said, The rebels; and named Gusho and Powussen: he
then varied, and said the Iteghé employed him. Before he was sent
away he contradicted all this, and declared, that Hagos, his brother,
had employed him; and that he was then actually in the camp, with
four others, who were determined to murder the Ras and Guebra Mascal,
whatever it should cost them.

A search was on this ordered through all the camp, but no stranger
found, excepting one of the same nation, who had planted himself and
his faggot near the tent of the Abuna; and who being seized, examined,
and promised pardon, declared himself absolutely ignorant of any
scheme but robbing, for which purpose three of them, he said, had come
into the camp together; one of them had stolen two mules the night
before, and gone off, and that he was that night intending to take
away two of the Abuna's mules; and he supposed his companion had the
same intention with regard to the Ras; but as to murder, or any other
plot, he knew nothing of it. Being put slightly to the torture, he
persisted in his declaration; and when interrogated, declared, that
they all three had come from Guragué with Amha Yasous, to load and
unload his baggage, and take care of his beasts: that none of them
had been at Gondar before the attempt, except the assassin, who had
formerly lived there some years, but whether with Hagos, or any other,
he did not know, nor did he ever hear him pronounce the name of Hagos,
nor see any stranger, whom he did not know, converse with him: that
they all three had lain the last night at the church of Serbraxos: but
he further declared, that the person apprehended spoke the Amharic
language as well as his own, contrary to what the villain had all
along pretended.

This declaration, which I heard from the king's secretary, word for
word as it was given, threw all the council into great confusion, the
more so, that, being gently talked to, and food given him after his
examination, at night the assassin had again repeated what he before
said about Gusho, and that Fasil, too, was accessory to the attempt.
And what made this labyrinth of lies still more intricate was, that
it was certainly known that Hagos, his brother, had constantly lived
with Coque Abou Barea, in Kuara, from the time Ras Michael had put
his brother to death at Gondar. It was intended therefore to try the
effect of further torture in the morning, to make him confess the
truth. His guard, however, having fallen asleep, or gone out of the
tent, he was found strangled by the running noose that was left round
his neck; nor was any further light ever thrown upon this affair at
any time after; but it was generally believed the attempt had been
made at the instigation of some connection of the Iteghé, and there
were some who went so far as to name Welleta Israel.

Early in the morning some priests came from Powussen, Ayabdar, and
Gusho, to take the most solemn oaths before the Abuna, that they never
had the smallest knowledge of what the assassin had laid to their
charge; and they took upon themselves sentence of excommunication,
which the Abuna then pronounced conditionally, if they had directly,
or indirectly, been principal or accessory, or known, or been
consulted, in any manner whatever, as to the designs of that assassin.
Several principal officers of the rebels, moreover, who had left
Gondar and gone over to Fasil, and who were there in Gusho's camp,
came over to congratulate with Ras Michael upon his escape, so that,
for a moment, one would have thought the whole country interested in
saving him whom all were actually in arms at that instant to destroy.
What surprised me most of all, probable as the thing might seem to be,
not one man in the camp, from the Ras and King downward, seemed to
think that this attempt of the Guragué had been in any shape the plot
of the rebels; and yet, in old times, murder by treason must have been
very frequent in his kingdom, as appears by their customs preserved to
this day; no person, be their station, connection, or friendship what
it will, can offer any one meat or drink without tasting it before
them.

Proposals of peace followed this friendly intercourse, but the
condition being always that Michael should depart to Tigrè, which
he thought was but in other terms a proposal to destroy him, these
friendly overtures ended in defiance and protestation, That to him
alone was owing the effusion of human blood, and the ruin of his
country, which was immediately to follow.

It was the 17th of May, at night, the attempt had been made on the
Ras's life; and the 18th was spent in excommunication before the
Abuna; and, in the evening, Michael received intelligence, that Ayto
Tesfos, from the mountains of Samen, and Heraclius and Samuel Mammo,
from Walkayt and Tzegadé, were both preparing to join the rebels
with a considerable force. We were now arrived at the fatal field of
Serbraxos, as we had endeavoured to pass it, but in vain; nothing now
remained but to try to find which side the devil (the father of lies)
had been forced to tell the truth, or whether he had yet told it to
either. Darion, a principal man of Belessen, and Guigarr of Lasta,
joined the Ras's army about noon, bringing with them 1200 men, chiefly
horsemen, good troops, and they were joyfully received.

A council was held with all the great officers that evening, and the
order of battle fixed upon for next day. Kefla Yasous, with the best
of the foot from Tigrè, with the king's household troops, the Shoa
horse, and the Moors of Ras el Feel, with their libds, (in all not
amounting to 10,000 men, but the flower of the army) composed the left
wing, in the center of which was the king in person, the heavy-armed
black horse before him, and the officers and nobility surrounding him:
Guebra Christos, and Kasmati Tesfos of Siré, commanded the center, in
which was Darion and Guigarr's cavalry, for the Lasta men, though of
different sides, could never be prevailed upon to fight against one
another, so instead of being with the king against Begemder and Lasta,
they were placed in the center against Gusho and Amhara. The right of
the king's army was commanded by Welleta Michael and Billetana Gueta
Tecla, opposed to the left wing of the rebels under Kasmati Ayabdar,
who had lately received large reinforcements from Gojam, by means
of the Iteghé, who well knew him to be an inveterate enemy to Ras
Michael, and one who would never make peace with him.

I have often heard it observed by officers of skill and experience,
that nothing is more difficult to describe than a battle, and that as
many descriptions as are given of it, they generally disagree, and
seem as many different battles. To this I shall add, that I find as
great difficulty in giving an idea of the ground on which a battle
was fought, which perhaps is not the case with professional men; and
though I describe nothing but what I saw, and what my horse passed
over, still I very much doubt if I can make myself intelligible to
my readers. The hill of Serbraxos was neither very high nor steep,
unless on the north and east, where it was almost a precipice. It
was not a mountain joined with others, as the bed of a torrent, that
ran very rapidly from Belessen south of Mariam-Ohha, divided it from
these mountains. The west side of it sloped gently to a large plain,
which extended to the brink of the lake Tzana, and upon this our rear
was encamped. The S. W. side of this hill was like the former, and
about half a mile from it came an elbow of the river Mariam, so called
from a church in the plain: on this side of the hill our center was
encamped with the king, Abuna, and the princesses; whilst on the south
face (which looked down a valley) was Ras Michael and the van of the
army: the hill here was considerably steeper, and I have already said
ended with the precipice on the north. Along the bottom of this south
face of the hill lay the small stream called Deg-Ohha, which stood in
pools, and was the safest and readiest supply for the army, as being
perfectly under command of our musquets, where our horses could water
without danger: immediately south from this ran a valley full half a
mile broad, which ended in a large plain about two miles off.

The valley where Michael and the van first engaged, was formed by the
hills of Belessen on the east, and the river Mariam on the west, and
near the middle of the valley there was a low and flat-topt hill,
not above 30 yards in height, which did not join with the hill of
Serbraxos. Between them there was an opening of about 100 yards,
through which ran Deg-Ohha, to the ford of the river Mariam, from
which you ascended in a direction nearly N. W. up into the plain which
reached to the lake Tzana. On the south end of this hill, as I have
said, which might have been about two miles in length, the banks of
the Mariam are very high, and the river stands in large deep pools,
with banks of sand between them. Where this hill ends to the right is
another ford of the river Mariam, where a deep and narrow sandy road
goes winding up the banks, in a direction N. W. like the former, and
leads to the same plain bordering on the lake Tzana: so that the plain
of the valley where the Mariam runs, which is bordered by the foot
of the mountains of Belessen, and continues along the plain south to
Tangouré, is near 200 feet lower than the plain that extends on the
side of the lake Tzana. Nor is there a convenient access from the
plain to the valley, at least that I saw, by reason of the height and
steepness of the banks of the Mariam, excepting these two already
mentioned; one between the extremity of the long even hill, and slope
of the mountain on the north, and the other on the south, through
the winding sandy road up the steep banks of the river, by the south
end of that low hill, as I have already said. At these two places are
the two fords of the river, which continue passable even in the rainy
season, and the water at that time stands in pools below it, till
several miles further it joins the Zingetch Gomara, a larger stream
than itself, whose banks are low, and where the stream is fordable
also; but the banks of the river Mariam continue steep, and run in
a southern direction. In this valley, at the south end of this hill
near the ford was the engagement between Michael with the van, and the
Begemder troops, on the 16th; at the ford on the north end of this
hill, in the same valley, was the fight between the light troops and
Kasmati Ayabdar, and the king in person, the very same day; so that
the valley was perfectly known by the enemy, and as they had few or no
musquetry, was wisely considered as not fit ground for their purposes
being narrow and commanded by hills everywhere.

On the 19th of May, word was brought that the whole rebel army was in
motion, and before eight o'clock (reckoned in Abyssinia an early hour
for such business) a great cloud of dust was seen rising on the right
of the rebels towards Korreva, and this was the moment the Begemder
troops got on horseback in the dusty plain; soon after we heard their
kettle-drums, and about nine o'clock we saw the whole troops of
Begemder appear, drawn up at such a distance in the plain, above the
road up the steep bank of the Mariam, as to leave great room for us
to form with the road on our left, and a little on our rear; Michael
easily divined Powussen's intention, which was to beat us back by a
superior force of horse, and then making a number of troops glide
below unseen, along the river in the valley, take possession of the
round hill, at the north ford of Mariam, and cut off our retreat to
our camp at Serbraxos; the Ras immediately dispatched some single
horsemen to take a view of the enemy more nearly, and report what
their numbers were, and where Gusho and Ayabdar were posted, for we
could distinguish the colour of the horses, and all the movements of
the Begemder troops, not being much above three miles distance, yet we
did not know whether they were alone, or whether one or more of the
other generals were with them: we saw indeed Powussen's standards, but
they were so weather-beaten and faded, that we could not distinguish
their real colours, which were blue and yellow.

The king's whole army was descending into the valley, and passing over
the ford of the Mariam, to the plain above where Kefla Yasous was
riding to and fro with great earnestness, encouraging his troops. In
a very short time the left was formed; the Ras, having given all his
orders, and taken to himself the charge of the camp and the reserve,
sat down, as was usual, to play at drafts with the black servants. The
army was now all in the plain, when the scouts arrived, and brought
word that Gusho and Ayabdar had both taken their ground, not directly
in a straight line from Powussen, square with the lake, but as it were
diagonally declining more to the southward, so that the most advanced,
or nearest to us, were the troops of Begemder; and this was probably
done, in order that, our backs being more turned to the lake, we might
be easier cut off from our camp, and surrounded in the plain, between
their army and the Tzana, if Powussen was so fortunate as to beat the
king and the left; but this disposition of these troops was out of
our sight, being down nearer the lake. Nor is it to be understood
that I mean here to give any account of their movements, or of any
other, unless those of the left wing under the king, where I was
myself engaged.

Several spies came into Ras Michael at this time, and they, and the
horsemen that had been sent on the service, all agreed, that in the
center of the Begemder horse a large red standard was displayed,
with a number of kettle drums beating before it, which the Ras no
sooner heard, than giving his draft board a kick with his foot, he
overturned the whole game, and afforded, at least, a bad omen of the
future engagement. He then called for Kefla Yasous, and Guebra Mascal,
and having conferred with them both, he detatched Guebra Mascal with
five hundred musqueteers to take possession of the hill in the valley
below, and coast along the left flank of our left without appearing in
sight.

The day had been exceeding close, seeming to threaten violent thunder,
and we were now come so near as to see distinctly the large red
standard, which being pointed out to the king, he said, smiling with
a very chearful countenance, "Aye, aye, now we shall soon see what
miracle king Theodorus will work." The clouds had been gathering ever
since we went down the hill, and some big drops of rain had fallen.
The soldiers were now covering their lighted matches, for fear of
more, when first a most violent storm of thunder, lightening, and rain
began, then a tempest of rain and wind, and last a dead calm, with
such a heavy shower that I scarce ever saw the like even in the rainy
season.

Had I been commander of the Begemder troops that day, this shower
should have been the signal of charging; for all the king's fire-arms
were useless, and the matches wet; but the Begemder horse seemed most
uneasy under the fall of rain; they began to be unmanageable, and turn
tail to the wind, which now arose and was directly in their faces,
and in a few minutes they wheeled about, and retired to their camp.
The king halted on the ground where he was, ordered the kettle-drums
to beat, and the trumpets to sound; and having continued half an hour
till the heavy shower began, he fell back as did the whole army, and
retired to the camp. When he got up the hill, and passed the brow
where Ras Michael was sitting with some slaves, who held up a piece of
sail-cloth over his head to keep off the rain, the servants raised the
Ras upon his feet; without any previous salutation, he then asked the
king what he had done with king Theodorus? and was answered, "Begemder
brought him, and Begemder took him away, we saw nothing but his flag."
Lasta carried his flag, says one of the nobility. He is a peaceable
prince, says the king; yet he begins with fighting, but he will make
amends afterwards, if he governs this country in peace a thousand
years. If he does that, says the Ras, Powussen is to die at the next
battle, for the thousand years peace will never begin, as long as he
is alive.

   the Second Battle of Serbraxos--Rash Conduct, and narrow Escape
   of the King--Both Armies keep the Ground._


The whole evening of the 19th of May was spent in festivity and joy;
a prophet from some part in Dembea had foretold the defeat of king
Theodorus, and what was much more interesting, two large droves of
cattle, the one from Belessen, near Mariam-Ohha, the other from
Dembea, were driven that day into the camp. Ras Michael, who knew
the value of to-morrow, spared nothing that might refresh the troops
this day. The king and he, Ozoro Esther, and Ozoro Altash, Kefla
Yasous, and the Abuna himself, gave each of them entertainments to the
principal officers of the army, and all those who were likely to bear
the burden of the ensuing conflict. The soldiers were in great spirit,
but it was now very generally known that the officers were mostly
disaffected, engaged in private treaties, and in daily expectation of
peace.

A very short council was held at the king's tent; all that could be
resolved upon had been already fixed the day before, and little had
happened since to occasion any alteration. All the young nobility
were, as usual, at Ozoro Esther's. It was with infinite pity I heard
them thoughtlessly praying for a warm and fair day to-morrow, the
evening of which many of them were never to see.

Besides the stores that Ozoro Esther always was provided with, the
king had sent her two live cattle, wine, brandy, and hydromel; and
what was a very unusual condescension, the Ras, immediately after
council, came into the tent, and brought with him a fresh supply.
He was very gracious and affable, said a number of kind things to
everybody, and asked me particularly how we drank in England?

I explained to him as well as I could the nature of our toasts, and
drinking to the health of our mistresses by their names in bumpers;
that our soldiers toasts on such a night as that, if the general
honoured them as he did us now with his company, would be, A fair
morning, and speedy sight of our enemy. He comprehended it all very
easily, and when I saw he did so, I asked if I should give my toast?
and he and all the company joining in a loud cry of approbation, I
filled a horn with wine, and standing up, for he had forced us all
to be seated, I drank, Long life to the king, health, happiness,
and victory, to you, Sir, and a speedy sight of king Theodorus. A
violent shout of applause followed. He himself (the soberest of men)
would drink his horn full, which he did, with many interruptions
from immoderate fits of laughter; the horn went quickly round, and
I ventured to prophecy, that, in the thousand years he is to reign,
Theodorus will never again be so chearfully toasted.

The Ras then turning to me said, I wish I had 5000 of your countrymen,
Yagoube, to-morrow, such as you are, or such as you have described
them. I answered. Would you had one thousand, and I had twenty
lives staked upon the issue. Ayto Engedan upon this got up, and
passing across the tent in a very graceful manner, kissed the Ras's
hand, saying, Do not make us think you undervalue, or distrust your
children, by forming such a wish: Yagoube is one of us, he is our
brother, and he shall see and judge to-morrow, if we, your own sons,
are not able to fight your battle without the aid of any foreigners.
Tears, on this, came into the old man's eyes, who took Engedan in his
arms, and kissed him; then recommending to us not to sit up late, he
withdrew. A great deal of buffoonery followed about toasts, and soon
after arrived two officers from the king, desiring to know what was
the reason of that violent outcry? by which he meant the shout when we
drank the toast. Ozoro Esther answered, We were all turned traitors,
and were drinking the health of king Theodorus. But it was afterwards
thought proper to explain the whole matter before the messengers went
back, and make them drink the toast also.

Tecla Mariam had not spoken much, her father having sent for her at
that time to the king. Before she departed, I begged Ozoro Esther to
apologise for me, that I had absented myself, and had not waited upon
her in the morning. I intreated her to continue her kind partiality
to me the next day, and to judge for ever of the esteem I had for
her by my then behaviour. She promised to do so with the utmost
complacency and sweetness, and departed.

Soon after this, a servant arrived from Ras Michael, with a
magnificent saddle and bridle as a present to Engedan. This man told
us that a messenger had come from Waragna Fasil, desiring a place
might be marked out for him to encamp, for he was to join the king
early in the morning; but nobody gave any credit to this, nor did he,
as far as I ever heard, advance a foot nearer the camp. The messenger
commanded us all, moreover, to go to bed, which we immediately
complied with. I only went to the king's tent, where the company was
dispersing, and kissed his hand, after which I retired. In my way
home to my tent, I saw a faggot lying in the way, when the story of
the Guraguè came presently into my mind. I ordered some soldiers to
separate it with their lances; but it had been brought for fuel, at
least no Guragué was there.

I was no sooner laid upon my bed, than I fell into a profound sleep,
which continued uninterrupted till five o'clock in the morning of the
20th. I had spared myself industriously in last night's carousal, for
fear of contributing to a relapse into despondency in the morning; but
I found all within serene and composed as it should be, and entirely
resigned to what was decreed, I was perfectly satisfied, that the
advancing or retarding the day of my death was not in the power of
the army of Begemder. I then visited all the horses and the black
soldiers, and ordered two or three of them, who were not perfectly
recovered from their hurts, to stay in the camp. I afterwards went
to the king's tent, who was not yet up; and the very instant after,
the Ras's first drum beat, and the king rose; soon after which, the
second drum was heard for the soldiers to go to breakfast. I went into
the king's tent to kiss his hand, and receive his orders. He told me
they were speedily then going to breakfast within, to which meal I
was engaged at Ozoro Esther's. He answered, Make haste then, for I am
resolved to be on the field before king Theodorus to-day. I am his
senior, and should shew him the example. He seemed more than ordinary
gay and in spirits.

I finished my breakfast in a few minutes, and took a grateful, but
chearful leave of Ozoro Esther, and received many acknowledgements,
and kind expressions, both from her and Tecla Mariam, who did not
fail to be there according to appointment. The day was clear, the sun
warm, and the army descended into the plain with great alacrity, in
the same order as the day before. Guebra Mascal, with his musqueteers,
took possession of the long hill in the valley, and coasted the
left flank of our left wing, the river Mariam and its high banks
being only between us. The king took his post, with the winding road
aforementioned (up the steep banks of the Mariam) close on his left.
Guebra Mascal having come to the south end of the hill below, marched
briskly up the road, and then advanced about 200 yards, making his men
lye down at the brink of the hill next the plain, among bent grass,
and thin tall shrubs like Spanish broom, so as to be perfectly out of
sight; his line was at right angles with our front, so that his fire
must enfilade the whole front of our line.

If not very useful, yet it may, however, be thought curious, to know
the disposition of a barbarous army ready to engage in a pitched
battle as this was. Kefla Yasous, who commanded the left-wing under
the king, placed his cavalry in a line to the opening of the road
down into the valley; between every two musquets were men armed with
lances and shields; then, at a particular distance, close before
this line of horse, was a body of lances, and musquets, or sometimes
either of them, in several lines, or, as they appeared, a round body
of soldiers, standing together without any order at all; then another
line of horse, with men between, alternately as before; then another
round corps of lances and musquets, advanced just before the line of
horse, and so on to the end of the division.

I know nothing of the disposition of the rest of the army, nor the
ground they were engaged on; that where we stood was as perfect a
plain as that commonly chosen to run races upon, and so I believe was
the rest, only sloping more to the lake Tzana.

The king's infantry was drawn up in one line, having a musqueteer
between every two men, with lances and shields. Immediately in the
center was the black horse, and the Moors of Ras el Feel, with their
libds, disposed on each of their flanks. Immediately behind these was
the king in person, with a large body of young nobility and great
officers of state, about him. On the right and left flank of the
line, a little in the rear, were all the rest of the king's horse,
divided into two large bodies, Guebra Mascal hid in the bank on our
left at right angles with the line, enfilading, as I have already
said, the whole line of our infantry; this will be easily understood
by consulting the plan where H H, G G, F, and I, represent the
disposition that I have now described.

It was full half an hour after the king had formed before the army of
Begemder made any motion. The Ras first saw them from the hill, and
made a signal, by beating his drums and blowing his trumpets; this was
immediately answered by all the drums and trumpets of the left wing,
and for the space of a minute, a thick cloud of dust (like the smoke
of a large city on fire) appeared on the side of Korreva, occasioned,
as the day before, by the Begemder troops mounting on horseback; the
ground where they were encamped being trodden into powder, by such a
number of men and horse passing over it so often, and now raised by
the motion of the horses feet, was whirled round by a very moderate
breeze, that blew steadily; it every minute increased in darkness, and
assumed various shapes and forms, of towers, castles, and battlements,
as fancy suggested. In the middle of this great cloud we began to
perceive indistinctly part of the horsemen, then a much greater
number, and the figure of the horses more accurately defined, which
came moving majestically upon us, sometimes partially seen, at other
times concealed by being wrapt up in clouds and darkness; the whole
made a most extraordinary, but truly picturesque appearance.

I was so struck with this, that I could not help saying to Billetana
Gueta Ammonios, who commanded the horse under me, Is not that a
glorious sight Ammonios! who, that was a king, would not be fond of
war? David, however, curses those that delight in war, says Ammonios.
Therefore, replied I, there must be pleasure in it, or else no body
would fall into a sin that was disagreeable in itself, and at the
same time forbidden by God. Well, well, replied Ammonios, this is not
a time for argument, see what a glorious spectacle we shall all be
before sun-set.

At this time Powussen's whole army was distinctly seen; they came
riding backwards and forwards with great violence, more as if they
were diverting themselves, than advancing to attack an enemy, of our
consequence, that was waiting them. They seemed like two wings, and a
main body, each nearly equal in numbers, as far as I could guess, and
are described in the plan by the letters L L, but they were sometimes
all in one croud together, and in such perpetual motion, that it was
impossible to ascertain their precise form.

Four men, upon unruly, high-mettled, or at least ill-broke horses,
rode galloping a small space before, conversing together, as if making
their observations upon us: they were now arrived at about six hundred
yards distance, but it was not a time to make accurate calculation;
they then made a stop, and began extending the left of their line to
the westward, as described by M M. I suppose, too, their horses needed
to breathe a little, after they had so imprudently blown them to no
purpose.

In the middle of their cavalry, or rather a little more towards their
right, than opposite to the place where the king was, a large red flag
was seen to rise, and was saluted by the drums and trumpets of their
whole army. An accident happened at this moment, which endangered
the discovery of the hidden part of our disposition, and which would
thereby have destroyed the sanguine hopes we had of victory, and
endangered the safety of the whole army. Upon displaying the red flag,
two musquets were fired from the post in the face of the hill where
Guebra Mascal lay in ambush. Luckily, at that very instant, all the
king's drums beat, and trumpets sounded, a kind of mock alarm, (such
as the posture-masters and mountebanks use,) in ridicule of king
Theodorus, and his red flag then flying before us.

Immediately upon this, as on a signal for battle, the whole army of
Begemder set out full gallop, to charge, as at N N, and a long hundred
yards before they joined, they received, through the very depth of
their squadron, a close well-directed fire from the whole musquetry of
Guebra Mascal, and from the king's line an instant after, which put
them into the utmost confusion, so that they in part came reeling down
upon our line, half wheeled about to the left, as men that had lost
their way, with their right, that is, their naked sides exposed as
they turned, their shields being in their left. The fire from Guebra
Mascal was the signal for our line to charge, and the heavy-armed
horsemen, with their pikes, broke thro' them with little resistance,
the line in the mean while, with horse and foot, closed with them,
after the musquets had given them their fire, and then staid behind to
recharge. Part of their left did not engage at all, but wheeled about,
and fled southward over the plain.

While their army was thus separated into two divisions, both in great
confusion, the king, with his reserve, fell furiously upon them; and
being followed by all the rest of the horse, they pushed the right
division (where Powussen was in person) along the plain, but these
retired, fighting very obstinately, and often rallying. Kefla Yasous
saw the great danger to which the king would quickly be exposed by
pursuing the troops of Begemder so far at a distance from his foot,
and that they would soon turn upon and overpower him with numbers, and
then surround him. He therefore, with great presence of mind, provided
for his retreat. He drew up the heavy-armed horse which could not
gallop, the Moors of Ras el Feel, and the foot which were left behind,
and which had now recharged their firelocks before the narrow road,
and ordered Guebra Mascal to resume his station. He then twice, with
great earnestness, cried in a loud voice to the soldiers, The king's
safety depends upon you,--Stand firm, or all is lost. After which,
he galloped, with a small body of horse, to join the king, closely
engaged at a considerable distance: The foot that had pursued, or were
scattered, now came in by tens and twelves, and joined the heavy-armed
horse, so that we began again to shew a very good countenance. Among
these, a common soldier of the king's household, busied in the vile
practice of mangling and spoiling the dead, found the red colours
of king Theodorus lying upon the field, which he delivered me, upon
promise of a reward, and which I gave a servant of my own to keep till
after the engagement.

At this instant Guebra Mascal came up from below the bank, leaping
and flourishing his gun about his head, and crying, just before my
horse, "Now, Yagoube, stand firm, if you are a man." "Look at me, you
drunken slave, said I, armed, or unarmed, and say, it is not a boast
if I count myself at all times a better man than you. Away to your
hiding-hole again, and for your life appear within my reach. Away! you
are not now, as the other day, before the king." The man cried out in
a transport of impatience, "By G--d, you don't know what I mean; but
here they all come, stand firm, if you are men;" and saying this, he
ran nimbly off, and hid himself below the bank, with his lighted match
in one hand, and all ready.

It is proper, for connection's sake, though I did not myself see
it, to relate what had happened to the king, who had pursued the
Begemder horse to a very considerable distance, and was then at S S
in the plan, when the whole army of the rebels that had not engaged,
observing the resistance made by Powussen, and part of the division
which they had left, turned suddenly back from their flight, and
at R R nearly surrounded the king and his cavalry, whom they had
now driven to the very edge of the steepest part of the bank of the
Mariam. Kefla Yasous's arrival, indeed, and his exerting himself to
the utmost, fighting with his own hand like any common soldier, had
brought some relief; yet as fresh horse came in, there can be little
doubt at the end, that the king must have been either slain or taken
prisoner, if Sertza Denghel, a young man of Amhara, a relation of
Gusho, and who had a small post in the palace, had not dismounted,
and offered to lead the king's horse down the steepest of the banks
into the river. To this, however, he received an absolute refusal. "I
shall die here this day, says the king, but while I have a man left,
will never turn my back upon the rebels." Sertza Denghel hearing
this vain discourse, and seeing no time was to be lost, took hold of
the bridle by force, at T, and happily led the horse along one of the
sheep-paths, slanting down the declivity of the bank. The king having
in vain threatened displeasure, and even death, with the butt-end of
his lance, in despair, struck Sertza Denghel in the mouth, and beat
out all his fore-teeth. A bank of gravel, like a bridge, separated two
deep pools, in the river Mariam, over which the king escaped, though
with difficulty, the ground being foul with quick sand.

All the foot that had remained about the king ran down the bank,
where the Begemder horse could not pursue them, and joined him in
the valley, where he made the best of his way towards the south
side of the long low hill, by the winding road, on the side of
which, and just above him, was placed Guebra Mascal. Ras Michael,
who saw the dangerous situation and escape of the king, and who
had kept Ayto Engedan near for some such purposes, dispatched him
with a considerable body of horse, along the low hill, ordering him
immediately to join the king, and cover his retreat; he likewise
detached a considerable body of musqueteers, and mounted for the
greater speed upon mules, who were directed to take post upon the
south end of the round hill, below the winding road, while another
party possessed themselves of some rocky ground on the south side
of the valley. This command was as soon executed as given. Ayto
Engedan joined the king, who had lost all his kettle-drums but one,
now beating before him, and upon his arrival at the entrance of the
valley, the king, at V, turned his face to the enemy, having the
musquetry, at X and Y, newly arrived from the camp on his right and
left.

Kefla Yasous was immediately acquainted with the king's escape, and,
knowing the consequence of protracting time, renewed the engagement
with so much vigour, that he pushed the horse of Begemder to some
small distance back into the plain. Powussen, whose only view was to
take the king prisoner, and wrest the possession of his person, and
with that his authority from Ras Michael, was much disconcerted at
the unexpected way by which the king escaped; he after this halted a
little for council, then divided his troops, with one part of which he
resolved to go down the winding road, and with the other to pass at
the junction of the rivers, and enter the valley in that direction,
in order to overtake the king, and intercept him in his way to the
camp, in case any thing obstructed his passing the winding road. Kefla
Yasous took advantage of this movement, and with his horse made his
way to join the heavy-armed troops, and those who had joined the line,
standing closely and firmly where they were stationed.

The first person that appeared was Kefla Yasous, and the horse with
him, stretching out his hand, (his face being all besmeared with
blood, for he was wounded in his forehead) he cried as loud as he
could, Stand firm, the king is safe in the valley. He had scarce
faced about, and joined the line, when the enemy approached at a
brisk gallop. The Begemder horse were closer than usual, and deeper
than the front was broad; they resembled therefore an oblong square,
if they resembled any thing; but the truth is, they were all in
disorder, and their figure, never regular, changed every moment; the
right of their front (which was not equal to ours) was finally placed
against the road, being close by Guebra Mascal's post, whose men were
much increased in number; they received the discharge of his whole
musquetry in two vollies, so near that I scarce believe there was one
shot that did not take place on man or horse. A great cry from the
bank at the same time added to their panic, which was answered by the
king's troops, who immediately charged them as before, as they wheeled
half round to the left. They were pursued, for a small distance,
by some of the troops that had not engaged in the morning, and it
was easy to perceive their disorder was real, and that they were
not likely to rally. By this last discharge, Powussen was slightly
wounded, and his men were plainly seen hurrying him off the field. In
the very instant the rebels turned their backs, Kefla Yasous ordered
all the troops, horse and foot, to file off down the narrow road into
the valley, behind the heavy-armed horse, who kept their ground before
the road, and there to join the king.

For my part, I thought the affair was over, when, last of all, we,
too, with our heavy horses, descended the road, where we found Guebra
Mascal, (whose activity was above all praise) drawn up on our right
along the foot of the bank, (with a large pool of water in his front)
flanking the valley, the king drawn up in the narrowest part of it,
and just engaged with the troops of Lasta and Begemder, that had gone
round by the junction of the rivers. These had lost, as we afterwards
heard, much time in giving their horses water. They were, however, the
more refreshed when they did come, and though they had received a fire
from the troops on the round hill, and from those posted on the rocky
ground, on the other side of the valley, they had beat the king and
Engedan back, and wounded him in the thigh.

At this time the Koccob horse, and Yasine with his Moors (who had the
charge of the road above till all the troops were gone) arrived, being
as it were shut out from the army, who were engaged at the other side
of the hill. Kefla Yasous, after descending through the winding road
into the valley, ordered Guebra Mascal to pass the pool, and stand at
the bottom of the winding road, for fear the enemy should enter at the
valley on the king's right, where the river ran, and so cut us off
from our camp.

This space he was then occupying when Yasine, first, and afterwards,
our black horse, arrived. He had, it seems, cried out to me before
from the side of the pool, but I had not then heard him. He now,
however, repeated, Where are you going, Yagoube? To die, said I,
surlily; it is the business of the day. He then added, Kefla Yasous
has crossed over behind Basha Hezekias, and fallen into the king's
rear. You know well, said I, our post is in his front. Then follow me,
cried Mascal, for by G--d I say you shall not take one step to-day,
but I will go five before you. So saying, he advanced very hastily,
and when he saw the Begemder colours retreating before the king, he
poured in a volley, which, though at a considerable distance, turned
all to a perfect flight.

We entered upon the smoke, just before the Shoa horse, with no loss,
and very little resistance, and came just into the place which
we occupied in the morning. Though the flight of the rebels was
apparently real, Kefla Yasous would not suffer a pursuit into the
plain, but advancing singly before us, began to form immediately;
the musquetry were planted on each side of the valley as far up the
hill as to be out of reach of the horse, and the rest of the infantry
in the plain; Basha Hezekias was on the round hill just behind the
center, where the king had placed himself, and Guebra Mascal nearly
where he stood before.

The army now made an appearance of a large section of an amphitheatre.
I observed the king had pulled off the diadem, or white fillet
he wears for distinction, and was very intent upon renewing the
engagement: the Begemder troops were forming, with great alertness,
about half a mile below, being reinforced from time to time. The
king ordered his drums to beat, and his trumpets to sound, to inform
the enemy he was ready; but they did not answer, or advance: soon
after (it being near three o'clock) the weather became overcast, and
cold, on which the troops of Begemder beat a retreat; the king, very
soon after, did the same, and returned to the camp without further
molestation; only that coming near a rock which projected into the
valley, (not far distant from the camp) a multitude of peasants
belonging to Mariam-Ohha, threw down a shower of stones from their
hands and slings, which hurt several. The king ordered them to be
fired at, though they were a great distance off, and passed on: but
Guebra Mascal commanding about fifty men to run briskly up the hill,
on each side of the rock, gave them two discharges at a less distance,
which killed or wounded many, and made the rest disappear in a moment.

I doubt that my reader will be more than sufficiently tired with the
detail of this second battle of Serbraxos; but, as it was a very
remarkable incident in my life, I could not omit it as far as I saw
it myself, and suppressing any one part of it would have involved the
rest in a confusion, with which I fear it may be still too justly
charged. I therefore shall only say for connection's sake, that Gusho
and Guebra Christos, in the center, were but partially engaged,
and Kasmati Tesfos of Siré, second commander for the king, in that
division, wounded, and taken prisoner. Guebra Christos, the king's
uncle, was slain, (as it was believed) by a shot of his own men; few
other lives of note were lost on either side, in that division. The
king's troops fell back under the hill of Serbraxos, where Michael
was, and, though followed by Gusho, were no further attacked by him.
But on the right, Billetana Gueta Tecla, and Welleta Michael, after a
very obstinate and bloody engagement, were beaten by Kasmati Ayabdar,
and forced across the river Mogetch, where, having rallied and posted
themselves strongly, it was not thought proper to attempt to force
them, and they all joined the camp soon after the king, but with very
great loss.

This battle, though it was rather a victory than a defeat, had,
however, upon the king's affairs, all the bad consequences of the
latter, nor was there any thinking man who had confidence in them
from that day forward. Near 3000 men perished on the king's side, a
great proportion of whom was of the left wing, which he commanded;
near 180 young men, of the greatest hopes and noblest families in the
kingdom, were among that number; Guebra Christos was in all respects
a truly national loss. Kefla Yasous was twice wounded, but not
dangerously, besides a multitude of others of the first rank, among
whom was Ayto Engedan, who by proper care soon recovered also, but
in the meantime was sent to Gondar, to his cousin Ayto Confu. On our
side, too, a son of Lika Netcho, and a son of Nebrit Tecla, were both
slain.--Providence seemed now to have begun to require satisfaction
for the blood of the late king Joas, in the shedding of which these
two were particularly concerned. Among the slain were our friends the
Baharnagash and his son, who died valiantly fighting before the king
at the time he escaped down the bank into the valley.

But what served as comfort to the king, was the still heavier loss
sustained by the enemy, who, by their own accounts that day, lost
above 9000 men, seven thousand of whom were from the troops of
Begemder and Lasta, with which the king was engaged. For my own part,
I cannot believe, but that both these accounts are much exaggerated;
the great proportion that died of those that were wounded must have
greatly swelled the loss of the rebels, because most gun-shot wounds,
especially if bones are broken, mortify, and prove mortal. Among
the slain, on the part of Begemder, were two chiefs of Lasta, and
two relations of Powussen, (a brother-in-law and his son) they were
both shot, bearing the banner of king Theodorus. The unworthy Confu,
brother to Guebra Mehedin, and nephew to the Iteghé, whom I have often
mentioned, had escaped, indeed, from Kasmati Ayabdar, who had given
orders to confine him, to die a rebel this day among the troops of
Begemder.

The king being washed and dressed, and having dined, received a
compliment from Ras Michael, who sent him a present of fruit,
and a thousand ounces of gold. There began then the filthiest of
all ceremonies that ever disgraced any nation stiling themselves
Christians; a ceremony that cannot be put in terms sufficiently decent
for modest ears, without adapting the chaste language of scripture,
which, when necessity obliges to treat of gross subjects, always
makes choice of the least offensive language.

All those, whether women or men, who have fiefs of the crown, are
obliged to furnish certain numbers of horse and foot. The women were
seldom obliged to personal attendance, till Ras Michael made it a
rule, in order to compose a court or company for Ozoro Esther. At the
end of a day of battle each chief is obliged to sit at the door of
his tent, and each of his followers, who has slain a man, presents
himself in his turn, armed as in fight, with the bloody foreskin of
the man whom he has slain hanging upon the wrist of his right hand.
In this, too, he holds his lance, brandishing it over his master, or
mistress, as if he intended to strike; and repeating in a seeming
rage, a rant of nonsense, which admits of no variation, "I am John the
son of George, the son of William, the son of Thomas; I am the rider
upon the brown horse; I saved your father's life at such a battle;
where would you have been if I had not fought for you to-day? you give
me no encouragement, no cloaths, nor money; you do not deserve such
a servant as I;" and with that he throws his bloody spoils upon the
ground before his superior. Another comes afterwards, in his turn, and
does the same; and, if he has killed more than one man, so many more
times he returns, always repeating the same nonsense, with the same
gestures. I believe there was a heap of above 400 that day, before
Ozoro Esther; and it was monstrous to see the young and beautiful
Tecla Mariam sitting upon a stool presiding at so filthy a ceremony;
nor was she without surprise, such is the force of custom, that no
compliment of that kind was paid on my part; and still more so, that
I could not be even present at so horrid and bloody an exhibition.

The superiors appear at this time with their heads covered as before
their vassals; their mouth, too, is hid, and nothing is seen but
their eyes: this does not proceed from modesty, but is a token of
superiority, of which, covering or uncovering the head is a very
special demonstration. After this ceremony is over each man takes his
bloody conquest, and retires to prepare it in the same manner the
Indians do their scalps. To conclude this beastly account, the whole
army, on their return to Gondar, on a particular day of review, throws
them before the king, and leaves them at the gate of the palace. It
is in search of these, and the unburied bodies of criminals, that the
hyænas come in such numbers to the streets, where it is dangerous,
even when armed, to walk after dark.

This inhuman ceremony being over, also the care of the wounded,
which indeed precedes every thing, the king received all those of
the nobility who had distinguished themselves that day; the tent was
crowded, and he was in great spirits at the slaughter that had been
made, which unbecoming pleasure he never could disguise. He mentioned
the death of his uncle Guebra Christos with a degree of chearfulness,
presuming, that when such a man died on his side, many of that rank
and merit must have fallen on the other. Villages, appointments, and
promotions, gold, promises, and presents of every kind, had been
liberally bestowed upon those who had presented themselves, and who
had merited reward that day by their behaviour. The king had been
furnished with means from the Ras, and according to his natural
inclination (especially towards soldiers) he had bestowed them
liberally, and I believe impartially. Guebra Mascal had not appeared;
he was waiting upon his uncle Ras Michael, looking after his own
interest, to which no Abyssinian is blind, and exposing those bloody
spoils, which I have just mentioned, to the Ras, his uncle and general.

I had been absent from another motive, the attendance on my friend
Engedan, to whose tent I had removed my bed, as he complained of great
pain in his wound, and I had likewise obtained leave of the Ras to
shift my tent near that of his, and leave the care of the king's horse
to Laeca Mariam, an old slave and confidential servant of the king.

As these men were the king's menial servants in his palace, a number
of them (about a fourth) staid at Gondar with the horses, and few
more than 100 to 120 could now be mustered, from about 200 or 204
which they at first were: the arranging of this, attendance upon Ayto
Engedan, and several delays in getting access to the Ras, who had
all his troops of Tigrè round him, made it past eight o'clock in the
evening before I could see the king after he entered the camp; he had
many times sent in search of Sertza Denghel, but no such person could
be found; he had been seen bravely fighting by Engedan's side in the
entrance of the valley, when that young nobleman was wounded, and he
had retired with him from the field, but nobody could give any account
of him, and the king, by his repeated inquiries after him, shewed
more anxiety, from the supposition he was lost, than he had done for
Guebra Christos his uncle, or all the men that had fallen that day;
I had seen him in Ayto Engedan's tent, sitting behind his bed, in the
darkest place of it; both his lips, nose, and chin were violently cut,
his whole fore teeth beat out, and both his cheeks greatly swelled. I
had given him what relief I could, nor was there any thing dangerous
in his wounds; but the affront of receiving the blow from the king,
when he was doing a most meritorious act of duty, (the saving him
from death, or the hands of the rebels), had made such an impression
upon a noble mind, that as soon as he arrived in Engedan's tent, he
had ordered his hair to be cut off, put a white cap, or monk's cowl
upon his head, and by a vow dedicated himself to a monastic life. In
vain the king flattered, rewarded, and threatened him afterwards, and
went so far as to make the Abuna menace him with excommunication if
he persisted in his resolution any longer. After this I carried him,
as we shall see, by the king's desire, to Gusho, in his camp, and
interested him also to persuade Sertza Denghel to renounce his rash
vow: no consideration could however prevail, for, like a private monk,
he lived at home in the village which belonged to him in patrimony,
and, tho' he often came to court, never slept or ate in the palace,
the excuse being, when desired to stay dinner, that he had _no teeth_.
He constantly slept at my house, sometimes chearful, but very seldom
so. He was a young man of excellent understanding, and particularly
turned to the study of religion; he was well read in all the books of
his own country, and very desirous of being instructed in ours; he had
the very worst opinion of his own priests, and his principal desire
(if it had been possible) was to go with me to die, and to be buried
in Jerusalem.

   Serbraxos._


After the engagement, as every body had access to the king's presence,
I did not choose to force my way through the crowd, but went round
through the more private entry, by the bed-chamber, when I placed
myself behind the king's chair. As soon as he saw me, he said, with
great benignity, "I have not inquired nor sent for you, because I knew
you would be necessarily busied among those of your friends, who have
been wounded to-day; you are yourself, besides, hurt: how are you?" I
answered, "that I was not hurt to-day, but, though often in danger,
had escaped without any other harm than excessive fatigue occasioned
by heat and weight of my coat of mail, and that one of my horses was
killed under Ammonios."

I then took the red colours from the servant behind me, and going to
the carpet spread before the king, laid them at his feet, saying, "So
may all your majesty's enemies fall, as this arch rebel (the bearer
of this) has fallen to-day;" a great murmur was immediately raised
upon seeing these colours, and the king cried out with the utmost
impatience, "Has he fallen into your hands, Yagoube? who was he,
where did you meet him, or where did you slay him?" "Sir, said I, it
was not my fortune to meet him to-day, nor did I slay him. I am no
king-killer; it is a sin, I thank God, from which my ancestors are all
free; yet, had Providence thrown in my way a king like this, I believe
I might have overcome my scruples. He was killed, as I suppose, by a
shot of Guebra Mascal, on the flank of our line; a soldier picked up
the colours on the field, and brought them to me in hopes of reward,
while you was engaged with the troops of Begemder, near the bank; but
the merit of his death is with Guebra Mascal. I do him this justice,
the rather because he is the only man in your majesty's army who bears
me ill-will, or has been my constant enemy, for what reason I know
not; but God forbid, that on this, or any personal account, I should
not bear witness to the truth: this day, my fortune has been to be
near him during the whole of it, and I say it from certain inspection,
that to the bravery and activity of Guebra Mascal every man in your
left wing owes his life or liberty."--"He is a shame and disgrace
to his family, says the king's secretary, who was standing by him,
if after this he can be your enemy."--"It must be a mistake, says
the king's priest (Kiis Hatzè), for this should atone for it, though
Yagoube had slain his brother."

While this conversation was going on, an extraordinary bustle was
observed in the crowd, and this unquiet genius pushing through it
with great violence, his goat's skin upon his shoulders, and covered
with dust and sweat, in the same manner he came from the field; he
had heard I was gone to the king's tent with the red flag, and not
doubting I was to complain of him, or praise myself at his expence,
had directly followed me, without giving himself time to make the
least inquiry. He threw himself suddenly, with his face to the ground,
before the throne, and rising as quickly, and in violent agitation, he
said to the king, or rather bellowed, very indecently, "It is a lie
Yagoube is telling; he does not say the truth; I meant him no harm
but good to-day, and he did not understand my language. I don't say
Yagoube is not as good a man as any of us, but it is a lie he has been
telling now, and I will prove it."

A general silence followed this wild rhapsody; the king was surprised,
and very gravely said, I am sorry, for your sake, if it is a lie;
for my part, I was rash enough to believe it was true. Guebra Mascal
was still going to make bad worse, by some absurd reply, when the
secretary, and one or two of his friends, hauled him out behind the
throne to one of the apartments within, not without some resistance,
every one supposing, and many saying, he was drunk; the king was
silent, but appeared exceedingly displeased, when I fell upon
the ground before him, (a form of asking leave to speak upon any
particular subject) and rising said, Sir, With great submission, it
is not, I apprehend, true, that Guebra Mascal is drunk, as some have
rashly said now in your presence; we have all ate and drank, and
changed our cloathing since the battle; but this man, who has been
on foot since five in the morning, and engaged all day, has not, I
believe, ate or drank as yet; certainly he has not washed himself, or
changed his habit, but has been taking care of his wounded men, and
has presented himself now as he came from the field, under the unjust
suspicion I was doing him wrong. I then repeated what had happened
at the bank when the king was pursuing the troops of Begemder. Now I
understand him, says the king, but still he is wrong, and this is not
the first instance I have seen, when there was
